Tyquan is an all-around easy going child with an infectious smile. He loves music and playing sports, especially basketball. Tyquan even aspires to be a professional basketball player. He also loves navigating on the computer. Tyquan is a very neat and clean child, as he keeps his clothes folded neatly in his room and when he dresses he wants everything to match..even his shoes. Tyquan is not a picky eater and will try most everything. However, he definitely has his favorites, which include Chinese, pizza, macaroni and cheese, and, most of all, peanut butter and jelly.    Tyquan is currently in middle school; however, he is working at a second grade level. He can read at a higher level but his comprehension of the material drops as the level rises. Therefore, it is important that his adoptive parents advocate on his behalf as ensuring he receives the necessary services. Tyquan also needs a family that would be able to provide a loving and structured home. If this sounds like your family, Tyquan is waiting for your call!
