Sylvester is a happy 14 year old African American boy. He has such a beautiful smile and can be very polite. Sylvester is not a picky eater, but like most boys his age, he prefers fast food instead of vegetables. Sylvester's three loves are Sponge Bob, monster trucks and football. He likes to play outside and does better in small groups or one on one. Sylvester has difficulties forming and maintaining relationships and would benefit from a family that is patient and understanding of his many needs. He will do best in a two parent home being an only child or youngest child in the home. The child would benefit from a family willing to care for him throughout adulthood and help guide him.
