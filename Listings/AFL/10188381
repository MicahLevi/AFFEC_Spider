Nathaniel is a handsome teen with great potential. He does well academically and LOVES to read. Nathaniel is a typical teen and might be inattentive at times or easily distracted. Subsequently, he will need to be monitored at times to ensure he stays 'on task.' Nathaniel is a creative soul and can be quite entertaining; although sometimes he does tell some 'tall tales.' He is an avid animal lover and wants to pursue a career in animal rescue. He LOVES interacting with all types of animals; dogs, cats, birds, reptiles etc. He also enjoys swimming and playing with video games. While Nathaniel gets along with his peers, he can be a bit strong willed but responds well to verbal redirection. Nathaniel would like to be in a home with a mother and father and other children. In addition he wants a family that resides in Florida. Nathaniel is typically well behaved but needs some guidance and encouragement so he will remain focused and motivated. Nathaniel really needs stability and a family to call his own. Nathaniel would make a great addition to any family and is sure to bring joy and love to anyone. Are you the right family for this future Veterinarian? If so, he is waiting for your call!
