Westly is an energetic, sports fanatic! He is a bit shy at first, but lights up when sports becomes the topic of the conversation. Westly loves to go fishing and relishes in the quiet of the early morning air. He also loves baseball and is eager to play baseball soon. He is hoping to find a family with a dad who is just as into sports as he is. Westly needs a loving and patient home where he can grow to his full potential. He is hoping for an African-American family with a mom and a dad.
