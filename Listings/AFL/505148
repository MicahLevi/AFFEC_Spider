Taychaun is a fun-loving teenager who prefers to be called Deseree. She is an optimistic and outgoing child who loves singing and dancing. She has dark eyes and hair and is very energetic. She has a beautiful smile and a sweet personality. She has entered and won two talent competitions with her lovely singing voice!   Deseree is on a unique journey. She is currently going through a transgender change in her life, which is something she has been going through for about one year. She was born male, but she expresses herself as a girl and has decided to be called Deseree. She began presenting as female in March of 2014. Deseree would greatly benefit from the stability and permanency that adoption would offer. She would prefer a single mom or a two-mom family.
