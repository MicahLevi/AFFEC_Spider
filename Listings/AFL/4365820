Thomas is a fun-loving teen who loves to have a good time. Although he is not sure what he wants to do as a future career, he is interested in working with animals as well as building things. In his free time, Thomas enjoys playing games and playing on the computer. He does at times struggle with communicating and relating with peers, but communicates very well one on one and with adults.
