Forrest is a very sweet, compassionate, and athletic child. Forrest enjoys playing most sports, especially football and basketball. His favorite foods are pizza and wings but he doesn't report any foods that he doesn't like! He loves to be active and play outside. Forrest would benefit from being matched with a strong and active family who enjoys the outdoors and sports. He is interested in being adopted by a mother and a father with children older than him.
