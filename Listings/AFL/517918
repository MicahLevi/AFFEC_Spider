Fun and playful, Zachary is a teenager looking for an adoptive home that will be his forever family. Zack loves playing video games and has life goals of becoming a marine one day. He states he would want to go to Afghanistan to fight for his country. Zack loves science and wants to do better in math. He has experienced a great deal of loss in his childhood and would love a mother and father and maybe a big brother. Zack will need a very consistent family that has a lot of structure and can deal with his some of his needs. Are you willing to take Zack into your home forever?
