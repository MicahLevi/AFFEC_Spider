Joshua is smart and funny. He does well academically; he is creative, artistic and can be quite energetic. Josh has aspirations of designing planes for the air force and wants to go to college to study mechanical engineering. Josh really enjoys playing video games, watching TV, playing on the computer, doing art-work/drawings and playing with animals. Josh is enthusiastic about animals and wants to be in a home that has dogs but would be extremely ecstatic if his new home had a Husky. Josh would like to be in a home with a mother and father where he is the only child; as he enjoys that 'one on one' attention. At times Josh can be very strong willed and has occasional emotional outbursts but is able to function in social settings . This child has two brothers he wants to stay in contact with and would benefit from a family who is willing to maintain that sibling bond. Josh really needs stability and a family to call his own. He needs parents who will be patient, provide guidance, encouragement, set boundaries and structure in order for him to be focused and motivated. Josh would make a great addition to any family. Are you the right family for this future Aeronautic Engineer? If so, he is waiting for your call!
