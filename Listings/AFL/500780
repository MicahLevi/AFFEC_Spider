Beau is a wonderful child with a great smile. Beau was diagnosed with Down Syndrome at birth. His caregivers do not report any major behavioral concerns as to Beau. Beau likes to get up and open and close doors and turn lights on and off. Beau get's along well with the other children in the home. Beau likes to throw things in the air and watch them fall. Beau will watch Sponge Bob and prefers musical toddler toys but his attention span is very short. Beau wears diapers and requires his food to be mashed or pureed. Beau is in a specialized classroom in his elementary school and requires assistance with his daily living skills. Beau is mostly non-verbal but is able to communicate some of his needs by pointing at pictures in his picture book. Beau will require a lifelong commitment from his adoptive family.
