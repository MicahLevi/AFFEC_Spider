Nicolas presents as a sweet and kind teenager. Nicolas enjoys video and computer games and watching his favorite cartoons. Nicolas receives specialized education services. He has been making marked improvements in school but does need to be reminded to do his homework. Nicolas is looking for a family who will love him unconditionally. A family that are active and enjoying going out frequently. A bonus would be someone who is a good cook. Nicolas would flourish in a home that accepts him as he is and one that would allow him to maintain contact with his older brother.
