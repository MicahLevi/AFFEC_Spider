Dakota is a vibrant teenage boy. He loves being on the computer and connecting through social media or playing games. Fashion is a priority for Dakota and he takes pride in his appearance and "looking good". He is respectful and sweet hearted. At present, Dakota is struggling with the idea of adoption and is working through many questions. Any adoptive families would need to be extremely patient with Dakota, and the process, as he sorts through his future and his past.
