Meet Jeremiah! Jeremiah is just approaching his teen years and has a strong need for a loving and supportive family. He has a passion for anything Rastafarian. Jerimiah, like most boys, enjoys listening to his music. He prefers the sounds of reggae and Bob Marley. This active young man also enjoys playing sports with soccer being his sport of choice. Jeremiah would do really well in a household that has a strong male role model to help to guide and support him through his teenage years.
