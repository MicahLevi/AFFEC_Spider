Jacob is a sweet, loveable young man. He thrives on routine and would do well in a home with a lot of structure where he would know what to expect next. One of his favorite things to do is ride in a car through a car wash. He gets a big thrill with the soapy water and various brushes and machines. Jacob also enjoys drawing pictures, reading magazines, and playing outside. Jacob has a connection to his grandfather and an ideal family for Jacob would help to facilitate that relationship.
