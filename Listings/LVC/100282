<p>Jason or JJ as he is called is a cute as a button Hispanic  little boy with some huge challenges. He is a very medically complex child. He is wheelchair bound but he can pull  himself along on the floor using one arm.  His other arm is not functional.  He has severe spastic quadriparesis, a history of failure to thrive and  a history of a shunt for hydrocephalus.  He recently had a g tube placed for slow growth and because he cannot  swallow. He is non verbal and does not  understand language although he does respond to familiar voices. He can  also bang things together, possibly as a way to communicate. His vision and  hearing are limited. He is described by  his foster family as sweet and loving.  He enjoys being held and culled and will pull a familiar personâ€™s head  down so he and be kissed. He likes  playing with soft plush toys. Obviously,  Jason needs a very special adoptive family who will be prepared to care for him  for his entire life as he will never be able to live independently. Jason was born in February, 2015. </p>
