<p>My'Onia is a very loveable, active and outgoing little  girl. She is in the fourth grade and  dose well in school-although on occasion she needs to work harder on her  citizenship grades. She loves coloring  and doing arts and crafts. She also  likes playing with dolls and video games, skating and basketball. My'Onia is very affectionate and she will  truly blossom in a home where she can receive lots of one to one time and  attention. She is very strong willed and  tends to push, limits so her adoptive family will have to be very patient and  consistent with her. My'Onia was born in  July, 2005. </p>
