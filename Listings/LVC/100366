<p><br />Francis is an engaging young man with the most wonderful smile and some big challenges.  He will be in the sixth grade and although he is very smart and he particularly loves math, he is struggling academically and needs a lot of support with his school work.   He loves video games and particularly geo-catching.   Francis is participating in counseling and needs an adoptive family who will support this for him as he learns good coping skills.  Francis gets along really well with adults and would do best in a home here he can have undivided attention and support.  One on one, heâ€™s a great conversationalist!    Francis was born in January, 2015. </p>
