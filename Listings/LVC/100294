<p>Trevjan or TJ as he is affectionately known is a  delight! He has beautiful sparking eyes  with long eyelashes and a smile that can light up a room. He also has some huge medical and physical  challenges that are stable but very complex.  TJ can do nothing for himself and he never will be able to do  anything. He needs total care. He does not talk but he makes a lot of  sounds. He cannot sit unassisted but he  is able to crawl on the floor and can pull up some. He loves music and will sway to it. He gives &quot;hi 5's&quot; and loves hugs  and kisses. TJ is a wonderfully engaging  child who needs a very special family who truly will be his forever family for  his entire life. TJ was born in June,  2004. </p>
