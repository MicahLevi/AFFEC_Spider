<p>Thomas is a little boy who is very anxious to be a part of a  family.. He is extremely active and  playful. He can also be very angry and  is dealing with lots of difficult behaviors and conflicting emotions. He loves swimming, basketball and of course,  video games. He is very affectionate  and loves to snuggle while watching TV.  He has been diagnosed with developmental delays and autism and a low  average intelligence. In school where  he is in the 4th grade he receives special services that focus on  helping him with his behaviors that can sometimes be explosive or immature. He also receives speech therapy. He is working on improving his social  skills. Over the last several months Thomas made tremendous progress.  Unfortunately however, he recently had to be moved and his behavior has been  deeply impacted by that loss. Another loss he has recently suffered is the  loss of his younger sisters who are being adopted separately from him so he needs a family who will keep him in  contact with him. Thomas was born in  April, 2005.</p>
