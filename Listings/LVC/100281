<p>Bright, energetic,  handsome, engaging and challenging best describe Jabari. This creative dare devil loves to do almost  anything active. He especially enjoys  riding his bike and skate boarding. He  also loves playing video games. He is very good on the computer. Jabari  sometimes struggles in school so he needs a very patient and consistent  adoptive family who will be able to work closely with his teachers. Jabari needs an unconditionally committed  adoptive family who can give him lots of one on one undivided attention and  close supervision. He would do best as  an only or youngest child. He is a young  man with a lot of potential and in the right adoptive family, he is bound to  flourish. Jabari was born in December,  2006. </p>
