He is also very bright but not very interested in school.  His favorite activities are skateboarding and playing video games.  Tanner has really started to blossom in his foster home.   Tanner gets along well with others and especially with little kids and he would make a great big brother.   Tanner needs an adoptive family who will allow him to maintain contact with some of his birth family members who remain very important to him.  Tanner was born in June, 1998.
