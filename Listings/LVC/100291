<p>Summer is a delightful, beautiful and outgoing young woman  who has big plans for her future! Laughingly  she says she would like to be another Einstein or Ben Franklin- or an author or  a lawyer who handles life and death cases. Summer describes herself as &quot;smart,  sweet, loving, unique, determined, dramatic and unique&quot; and at the moment,  &quot;emo&quot;. She is very smart and  working way above her grade level in several subjects. She especially loves to read. Her favorite subjects are history, language  arts and reading. She also likes music  of all kinds and is learning to play the violin. She likes to cook and her favorite foods are  Italian. She hates carrots. Summer has had a lot very difficult and  painful experiences and she needs an unconditionally committed and loving  adoptive family to help her heal. She is  a child with wonderful potential and talents and in the right family she will  surely blossom! Summer was born in June,  2001. </p>
