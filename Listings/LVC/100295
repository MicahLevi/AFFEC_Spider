Matthew is very outgoing.  He is very funny and is often the class clown- although this does get him into trouble sometimes.    Jeremy is more studious than his brothers and an A/B honor roll student.  He is a very well behaved young man with high expectations for himself and others.   William like Matthew is an extremely active young man who is always on the go.  Elaina is a typical princess.  These children can be challenging some times but they are definitely worth the work and they will make some special adoptive family very proud one day.   Matthew was born in April 2004, Jeremy was born in October, 2005, William was born in Nov, 2008 and Elaina was born in Oct. 2011.
