<p>Hope is a pretty young woman who really hopes she will have an adoptive family of her own soon.  She comes to us because of drug abuse by her parents and a disrupted relative placement.   She is outgoing and sociable.  She likes music and drawing.  She can be kind and respectful- or not, depending on the situation.   Sometimes she tries to be provocative to keep things stirred up as a defense mechanism to hide her real feelings.   She is in the 10 grade where she is struggling academically and behaviorally.   Hope needs a very tolerant adoptive family who understand teenaged behaviors and who will not be easily shocked.  She also needs a family who will allow her to remain in contact with her brother and other relatives who remain important to her.  Hope has a lot of potential but it is going to take a very special family to help her realize that and achieve all that she can.  She can be a very challenging adolescent but she will also be a very rewarding young woman in the right adoptive family.  Hope was born in November, 2000. </p>
