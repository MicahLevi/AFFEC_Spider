<p><br />Dillion says his goal is to be adopted by the time school is out this year as he very much wants to be a part of a forever family.   He loves watching television and has a great sense of humor when it comes to the commercials.  He’s very artistic and enjoys doing arts and crafts, playing video games and going to McDonalds for a special treat.  School is not his favorite activity and he needs a lot of encouragement and support with his academics.    Dillion comes from a very difficult background.  On top of that, he has Muscular Dystrophy and some other medical challenges.   At this time he is almost totally confined to his wheelchair and this is increasingly frustrating for this once active little boy.   When this challenging charmer is happy he is very loving, affectionate and appreciative.   When he’s upset or frustrated he sometimes responds with angry outbursts so he needs a very supportive and understanding adoptive family who can help him learn to channel his anger more appropriately.   Dillion’s family will also have to be able to keep up with his changing medical needs and many appointments as well as to be creative about encouraging his abilities and helping him to adapt and participate in outdoor activities that have meant so much to him in the past.  Can you help Dillion make his dreams come true so he can be adopted by the end of this school year?   Dillion was born in April, 2001. </p>
