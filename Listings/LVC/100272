<p>Cameron is an active, energetic young man with a flair for  style and looking good! He is also extremely polite. He describes himself as a “homebody” who  enjoys art, video games and superhero movies. He would love to be in the Art Club in school.  He has quite a collection of books as he  also loves reading and music. He is a  very curious young man and he asks a ton of questions about everything. Church is very important to him. Cameron has the potential to do well in a very  patient family that will give him all the unconditional attention and affection  he has missed in his short life.  Cameron was born in Jan, 2004. </p>
