<p>Three energetic brothers who need a family where they can be  back together again. These boys have  been through a tremendous amount of turmoil and have had many losses. Nevertheless, they are incredibly resilient  and they want another adoptive family where they will be loved and respected. As Kyler once said, “I want a mom and dad who  are nice and who give hugs and kisses”. Likely  Parker and Tucker would agree with this wish.  Kyler is very creative and he loves to tinker and take things apart and  then figure out how to put them back together again- and he is very good at  it. He is currently in the 6th  grade and receives special services to help meet his special needs. He makes average grades in school. Kyler enjoys being active and he loves  basketball, football and fishing. He of  course also loves playing video games.  Parker is a very active, very sweet, shy little boy. He is in the third grade where he also receives  special services for his challenges. He  loves playing with Legos and collecting Pokémon cards. Tucker is a mischievous  little boy who has the most wonderful simile.  He is also very active and has enjoyed playing soccer on a city league  team. He also loves playing with Legos  and superheroes and listening to rap music.  Tucker is in the second grade and also receives special services in  school. These brothers have each have had  tremendous challenges and sometimes their behaviors reflect these. As fun as they are these brothers can also be  very challenging and they need a creative adoptive family with as much energy as they  have and who can keep them busy. Their  family is also going to have to understand why they sometimes act like they do  while helping them to feel safe and secure.  Kyler was born in May 2005.  Parker was born in May 2006 and Tucker was born in July 2007. </p>
