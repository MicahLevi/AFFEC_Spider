She is very active in her church youth  group. Haley needs an adoptive family  that will allow her to remain in contact with her sisters who are being adopted  separately. She will do best in a family  where she is the youngest child or only child.  She has been through a lot of trauma and she needs a very understanding,  loving family who will be able to give her lots of individual attention and  help her heal from her past experiences.  She was born in June, 2001.</p>
