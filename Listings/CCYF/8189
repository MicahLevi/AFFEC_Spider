Brandon has an eagerness to learn ways to better manage his responses and reactions when negative emotions surface. He brings a lot of insight and ideas for how to best navigate himself. He is very motivated and has done a great job. His caregivers are very proud of him. Brandon is aware of what triggers him and has identified healthy ways to cope that sometimes includes listening to music, taking deep breaths, drawing, or counting to three in his head before acting on his feelings.<p><p><p><p>
