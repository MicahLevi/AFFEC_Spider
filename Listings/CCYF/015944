                    <span id="DescRepeater_DetailsDesc_0">Nevaeh is a very sweet, kind-hearted, and caring child. She sometimes comes off as a caretaker to those around her and is often observed to be assisting adults. Adults in her life describe Nevaeh as polite and well-mannered.<p><p>
Nevaeh’s teacher describes her as a joy to have in the classroom and says that she is never disruptive. Nevaeh initially presents as shy. But once she is comfortable, she can become a social butterfly, spreading her colorful wings. She gets along with her peers and has many friends at her school. Nevaeh says she enjoys going to school and likes her teacher and her classmates. She is hesitant to ask for help from others when she struggles in school and needs to be reminded that it is okay to do so.<p><p>
Nevaeh is also very strong-willed and enjoys figuring things out on her own. She is very protective of her birth family and her siblings. Nevaeh participates in after school activities and is on the basketball team. She also enjoys participating in arts and crafts with her sister, Nyla. They enjoy watching and going to movies, swimming, and playing outside. Nevaeh likes watching television shows and playing with her toys.<p><p>
Nyla is a very sweet and spirited little girl. She is polite and well-mannered with adults and wants to please others. When asked what Nyla wants to be when she grows up, she says she wants to be a “lawyer” because she wants to help people. She says that, when she sees people who are upset, she likes to draw pictures to make them feel better. Nyla also enjoys swimming, playing outside, and running around with her siblings.<p><p>
Nyla reports that she enjoys going to school every day and she has a handful of friends in her class. Nyla thrives in small groups and with one-on-one attention. Her favorite class in school is art and, in her free time, she likes to engage in art/craft activities. 

Nyla is an insightful and empathic child who is able to recognize her own emotions and the emotions of others. She can be reserved and shy like her big sister when first meeting new people but, once comfortable, she becomes very social, too. Nyla is very energetic and is at her best when engaging in activities that she enjoys.<p><p>  
Nyla and Nevaeh share a strong bond and spend most of their time together. The girls prefer to sleep in the same room and be a part of the same activities. Nyla will often look to Nevaeh for comfort and assurance. Nevaeh and Nyla would succeed in either a single parent or two-parent household. Nevaeh wishes for a strong father-daughter relationship, and her care team is hopeful she will find one with her no-matter-what family. Both girls enjoy having many siblings in the home, especially younger siblings. Nyla and Nevaeh talk positively about coming from a large family. Even so, they may do best in a household where they are able to get one-on-one attention from a parent. Nevaeh, especially, needs the opportunity to be a kid, rather than a caregiver for her sister and others. Ideally, their no-matter-what family will commit to keeping a connection with their younger siblings, too.</span>
