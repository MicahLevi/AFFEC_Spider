                    <span id="DescRepeater_DetailsDesc_0">Kevin is an affectionate kid who loves to learn new things. Kevin works hard at his academics and has increased his knowledge of letters and sounds. He excels in writing and copying words and letters without tracing them. Kevin is also learning to count to 20 and identify numbers on his own. Kevin has a knowledge of basic cooking skills and can help in the kitchen, which goes hand and hand with his love of food. Some of Kevinâ€™s favorite foods are pizza, tacos, and cheese and crackers.<p><p>

Kevin is working with his treatment team learning how to better communicate his wants and needs. He has made some favorable advances recently, meaning he is also building positive relationships with his caregivers.<p><p>

Kevin really enjoys music with an upbeat tempo and loves to dance along to the rhythm. His favorite instruments are bells, maracas, and using his hands to make a drum. 
Kevin also enjoys watching and playing sports, with his favorite being basketball. He enjoys shooting hoops and bouncing the ball around. Kevin also likes to play catch.<p><p>

Kevin is looking for a family that has some knowledge of parenting children with unique challenges and special needs. He would also benefit from a family that is patient and can provide a home with structure and routine. Kevin does have a team of outside service providers that may be able to support the family in the home. He has an active relationship and a significant bond with his biological parents, so a family that would be understanding of and willing to carry on this connection would be greatly appreciated.<p><p>
