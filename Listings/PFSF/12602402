<p>With Javarius, there’s never a dull moment. He’s an outgoing boy who’s quick to strike up a conversation. He loves to have fun, and he thrives when he’s allowed to be the center of attention. Javarius is a very active child who loves to be outside and be on the go. His current favorite activities include Tae Kwon Do and playing Minecraft video games. Javarius is a very smart and curious child who asks many questions and is eager to learn more. Javarius would like to have a strong male role model who likes to be active. He thinks he’ll learn a lot from a fun dad. He’s looking forward to having parents who will provide a structured, loving home where he can really shine.</p>
