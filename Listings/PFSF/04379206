<p><strong>Rachel</strong><em> – 12 years old</em></p>
<p>Rachel is a perfect fit for anything outdoors! She loves to swim and enjoys playing basketball. After a day outside, she likes to wind down by watching television, including her favorite show, Teen Titans Go. She also has a soft spot for the movie Startdust. As a bright young girl, Rachel does well in school. She especially enjoys art. She’s also very articulate and appreciates when adults include her in decision making. Always willing to lend a hand, Rachel often helps out around the house. She loves to care for animals and is glad to pick up after herself.</p>
<p>Rachel would benefit from loving and supportive parents who will show patience as she adjusts to changes. She also want her future family to be willing to help her reconnect with her siblings. Most of all, Rachel is looking for a family who will enjoy sharing her success and watching her grow!</p>
