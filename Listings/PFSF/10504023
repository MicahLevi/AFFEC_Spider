<p>Have you ever dreamed of being a coach? For Malik, you could be even more! Malik is a smart and active teen who’d like to be part of an active, sports-loving family. He’d love to have parents who would join him in a game of basketball or football. He also wants his future parents to be positive role models, who can help him navigate the difficult task of becoming independent. Malik does well in school and is very respectful of others. He’s very well mannered, but he would still benefit from having parents who will advocate for his growth and success. With a loving and supportive “home team,” he’s certain to make any parent proud.</p>
