<p><em>When asked what she would bring if she was deserted on an island and could only bring three items, Cindy shares that she would bring a solar refrigerator so she would not go hungry, her friends to keep her company and a boat so she would be able to leave the island. </em></p>
<p>Cindy is a spunky, kindhearted and smart teen. Although she can be a shy and quiet-natured, she also has a great sense of humor and imagination. Cindy enjoys watching action movies and vampire television shows, cheerleading and relaxing at home. She is very driven and aspires to be able to attend college and study medicine. Cindy is very caring toward others and sees herself being a veterinarian or a nurse in the future.</p>
<p>She hopes for a family who will support her aspirations and her desire to maintain contact with her siblings.</p>
