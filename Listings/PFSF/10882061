<p>Jason is a vibrant and energetic young man of small stature. Jason primarily communicates his needs through verbal cues and the use of some sign language. Jason loves the outdoors and really enjoys activities such as running and kicking a ball. He also enjoys playing in water, listening to music and singing nursery rhymes. Jason would benefit from having a family who has the ability to attend to his daily needs and are committed to advocating for him throughout his life. He needs a family able to ensure that he continues to receive services that will help him reach his full potential in life.</p>
