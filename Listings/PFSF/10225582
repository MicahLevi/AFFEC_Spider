<p>Destiny is a very outgoing young lady who loves to be the center of attention. She loves swimming and her favorite subject at school is science. Destiny enjoys getting to dress up and have her hair and nails done. She is very into the latest fashion as well and like most girls her age, she loves a good shopping trip to the local mall. She would do well in a family who will advocate for her educational needs and assist her in growing into a successful young lady.</p>
