<p><strong>Matthew</strong><em> – 14 years old</em></p>
<p>Matthew’s a considerate child.When someone around him needs anything, he always wants to help. He’s the kind of person who wishes he could have the flu, so you don’t have to. Matthew enjoys reading and drawing.After school, he likes to take time to watch a show on television or play video games. He’s currently a fan of the newest Pokémon edition for his DS. Matthew would benefit from a structured and loving family who would advocate for his growth. He’s looking forward to having parents who would be good role models and who would enjoy helping him set personal goals.</p>
