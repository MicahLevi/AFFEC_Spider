<p><strong>Nicholas</strong><em>â€“ 16 years old<br />
 </em><br />
 Nicholas is a very active teenage boy who loves to play outside. Healso enjoys being indoors playing his video games. Nicholas issometimes shy but can be very engaging once he becomes comfortable. Although Nicholas can be spunky and impulsive, he also has a definite gentle side that is quite endearing. He is eager to please, and would very much like to find a family who will make him feel safe, loved and wanted forever. He will do best in a home with a positive male role model, where he is the only child or youngest sibling and where he will receive clear and firm guidelines, as well as lots of the one-on-one attention he craves. The ideal family for Nicholas would enjoy outdoor activities and would provide him with appropriate outlets for his energetic personality.</p>
