<p><strong>Deja</strong><em> – 16 years old</em></p>
<p>Deja is a very happy child, and she’s almost always in high spirits! Her caregivers describe her as “fun-loving” and a child who “goes with the flow.” She rarely fusses, unless she’s tired or hungry. She loves all kinds of different foods! While Deja needs a lot of one-on-one attention and assistance with her daily needs, she continues to make steady, consistent progress with her current foster family. Deja learns a lot from her teachers and other adults in her life. She deserves a family with patience and lots of love.</p>
