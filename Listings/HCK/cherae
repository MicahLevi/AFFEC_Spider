She would like a family with lots of siblings, but her caregivers think she would do best in a home with fewer children and less commotion. She would like a two-parent family. She says she wants someone who will talk to her, have a schedule, listen, take care of her, be nice and do what they say they will do. She wants someone who will understand and care for her even when she has a bad day.</p>
