            <h2>Meet Virginia Grace</h2>
            <h4>Born February 2002</h4>
            <p>Her name is Virginia Grace, but she prefers to be called Grace. She’s 14 and as you can tell by her photo here, she likes horseback riding. She also likes to play basketball and softball.</p>
<p>She likes school and gets As and Bs. She likes social studies because she gets “to learn about history that I wasn’t here for.” She works very hard to get good grades, in part because she says she doesn’t want to disappoint her family or friends.</p>
<p>Even though she’s a teen now, she still loves her stuffed animals. She has been on only one vacation, to Myrtle Beach, and would like to travel more, including to Paris.</p>
<p>Grace describes herself as quiet and respectful, but also sweet and bold.</p>
<p>She’s hoping for a family that has pets and “one that treats me like their own.”<a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/VirginiaGrace1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4065" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/VirginiaGrace1.jpg" alt="VirginiaGrace1" width="652" height="868" /></a></p>
