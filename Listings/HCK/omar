            <h2>Meet Omar</h2>
            <h4>Born April 1999</h4>
            <p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Being topsy-turvy is the name of the game with Omar. He’s an active and dynamic teen who loves tumbling and who wants to someday be a gymnast. Omar also is good at basketball, and likes being part of a team.</span></p>
<p>Hanging out at the Boys & Girls Club or the local rec center is Omar’s activity of choice; he appreciates the social atmosphere and the chance to be around other kids his age. In fact, he’d love to be adopted by a family where he would have a brother close to his age, as long as the family is fun and likes to participate in lots of sports!</p>
<p>In the winter, Omar catches up on his reading, but in the summer it’s all about the swimming pool and the park. If he could live in Florida where it’s warm and he could swim all of the time, he would!</p>
