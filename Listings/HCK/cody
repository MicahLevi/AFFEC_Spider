            <h2>Meet Cody</h2>
            <h4>Born July 2005</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Cody-10-2014.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2698 alignright" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Cody-10-2014.jpg" alt="Cody 10-2014" width="210" height="316" /></a>Cody is very eager to be adopted and be part of a family. He needs a family that can adjust their expectations of him to meet his current social, emotional and educational functioning. While Cody has great potential, he needs parents who are extremely patient and willing to learn how to effectively communicate with him and advocate for him educationally and with other service providers.</p>
<p>Cody loves music, especially Christian and country music. He enjoys being outside riding his bike, swimming or camping. Cody would like to live in a rural setting or somewhere he will have a lot of room to safely run around and play outdoors.</p>

He is most proud that he knows how to read and write and writes notes to everyone to show them how good he is. Cody is very active and loves to help around the house. He loves to work in the garden.</p>
<p>This young man can be described as respectful, responsible, eager, dynamic and strong.</p>
<p>Cody would do best in a home with consistency, patience and understanding and desires a strong male role model. He would also do best as the youngest or only child in the home.</p>
