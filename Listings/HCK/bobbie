            <h2>Meet Bobbie</h2>
            <h4>Born August 2007</h4>
            <p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Bobbie-Lewis-0807igbl.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-416" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Bobbie-Lewis-0807igbl-150x150.jpg" alt="Bobbie Lewis 0807igbl" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Bobbie-Lewis-0807igbl-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Bobbie-Lewis-0807igbl-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Bobbie-Lewis-0807igbl.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>When she feels enchanted , 7-year-old Bobbie dances as if among fairies from another world, according to her foster mom. She likes to jump, bounce and twirl. She seems to have an angel on her shoulder because out of nowhere, Bobbie will light up and laugh. Since her balance has improved, this little sprite is on the go and loves to go up and down steps with a little help. She enjoys learning through touch and exploring new sights and sounds. Playing games that light up and make noise makes her smile. Currently, Bobbie’s favorite toy is a keyboard that she can play on her own. She focuses on the sounds she makes with every key stroke. Bobbie also likes to cuddle with soft stuffed animals and bounce on the bed.</span></p>
<p>Bobbie will take caregivers by the hand and lead them where she wants to go. A recent trip to the Festival of Lights held a lot of wonderment for Bobbie, who had a blast! Bobbie is non-verbal but has communicated with some awesome sounds like a duck’s “quack” and she has even hummeda tune!</p>
<p>When it’s dinner time, Bobbie seems to enjoy that act of sitting around the table with family more than actually eating. She is fed through a G-tube and also will eat smooth purees orally. Her foster brothers provide a lot of entertainment. She loves to push them down and they are more than happy to exaggerate their fall to get a cheerful reaction.</p>
<p>Life with Bobbie can be a rollercoaster, according to her foster parents, but also extremely rewarding. She needs a family that can appreciate and value those moments when she is happy and comfortable. She also needs a family who is proactive in seeking out resources to expand those wonderful times. Please contact us if you can provide a loving home for Bobbie and can care for her needs with understanding and support.</p>
