            <h2>Meet Elijah</h2>
            <h4>Born May 1999</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/ZH31508ibej.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2966 alignright" alt="ZH31508ibej" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/ZH31508ibej.jpg" width="322" height="288" /></a>Elijah proudly displays his <em>Pokemon</em> and <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> cards that are neatly tucked into protector sheets in his binder. This sweet teenager also likes to collect baseball and football cards. Elijah may be serious about his collections, but the rest of his personality is playful and fun-loving. He seems quiet at first, but it doesn’t take long for him to start joking and goofing around.</p>
<p>Elijah likes going to school and does well– especially in math, which is his favorite subject. After the bell rings, he usually heads to the local rec. center to shoot hoops or hang out with his friends. In the summer months, Elijah will spend hours in the pool. He swims like a fish and can do some pretty cool moves off of the diving board. He says his favorite foods are ribs, hotdogs, and Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.</p>
<p>Elijah also has a love of cars and monster trucks. Attending a car show to check out classic cars and hot rods would be awesome for him.</p>
<p>Energetic Elijah loves the outdoors, boy scouts and camping; he wants a family that also enjoys nature. He is looking for a family that likes to go out to eat at restaurants and take trips to the zoo and museum.</p>
