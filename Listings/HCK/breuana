            <h2>Meet Breuana</h2>
            <h4>Born June 1999</h4>
            <p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0019.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4779" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0019.jpg" alt="" width="313" height="406" srcset="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0019.jpg 1508w, https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0019-231x300.jpg 231w, https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0019-768x997.jpg 768w, https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0019-789x1024.jpg 789w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></a>This intelligent and courteous young lady says she would like to be a police officer when she grows up. Breuana is an energetic, sweet, and eager girl who describes herself as always willing to lend a helping hand. Breuana has recently become more active in her church. She is currently participating in a weekly Bible study and has taken a lead role by adding thoughtful topics for discussion. <a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/breauna.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3914 alignright" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/breauna.jpg" alt="breauna" width="279" height="197"></a></span></p>
<p>Breuana also loves to write and read fiction. She is proud of her academic accomplishments, and says she enjoys school. Her favorite class is math because it’s easy for her. Breuana’s teacher has nothing but praise for her performance in class and says she adds humor throughout the day with her wonderfully silly nature.</p>
<p>Outside of school and church, she likes to listen to hip-hop music; her favorite singer is Beyonce. She also loves to eat potato chips and macaroni and cheese. When she has the opportunity, Breuana loves to go to the salon and get her hair done. Breuana lives for the summer season and loves to take vacations, so a family that likes to travel would be a great fit. Breuana’s dream is to some day travel to Rome and check out all the sights.</p>
<p>Breuana needs a consistent, caring and warm family that can commit to providing a loving, permanent home. She would also do well with a family that enjoys attending church and values her interest in school. Breuana is in the Jr ROTC and would like a family who would support this endeavor.</p>
