<p>He describes himself as loving and kind and frankly, we agree. Jude loves to go shopping with his friends and hang out at the mall. His favorite musical artist is Drake and he enjoys action or comedy movies.</p>
<p>When asked about his favorite fun place to visit, he said he had a great experience in Gatlinburg and would love to go there again someday.<a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Jude.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3163" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Jude.jpg" alt="Jude" width="550" height="550" /></a></p>
