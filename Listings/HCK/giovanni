            <h4>Born October 2002</h4>
            <p>This helpful and responsible young man does well in school and enjoys reading adventure books. He also likes to play outside during his free time and he loves to laugh.</p>

His favorite subject in school is math, because he gets to learn new things every day. He describes himself as active and strong. He works really hard to keep his room clean and helps out around the house. Giovanni is proud of his artistic abilities and he hangs his drawings on the wall proudly for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Giovanni is looking for a caring and supportive family that can provide understanding as he copes with separation and loss. He also needs a family to support him and give him structure and guidance as he grows and matures.</p>
