            <h2>Meet Lizzy</h2>
            <h4>Born January 2004</h4>
            <p></p>
<p>Lizzy loves to play. Whether it is inside making up dance routines or outside riding her bike with friends in her neighborhood, she is always having fun. Lizzy likes meeting new people and making new friends. She is a “girly girl” who enjoys accessorizing and getting her hair done in new styles. She loves to laugh and usually has a big grin on her face.</p>

<p>This sweet girl likes to play with her Barbies. She has quite the collection and will spend all afternoon dressing them up and doing their hair. Lizzy loves relaxing and watching the Disney Channel. Her favorite shows are <em>Good Luck Charlie</em> and <em>Shake It Up</em>.</p>
<p>Lizzy does well in school and is well-liked by all her teachers. After school, she enjoys going to after-school camp where she can play with her friends and get help with her school work.</p>
<p>Lizzy would do well in a family that can give her individual attention and spend one-on-one time with her. She needs an active family where she is the youngest or only child. She would like a home with a cat or small dog, but not one with larger animals.</p>
