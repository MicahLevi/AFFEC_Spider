            <h2>Meet Jayvonna</h2>
            <h4>Born September 2004</h4>
            <p>Jayvonna describes herself as nice, respectful and responsible and dreams of being in a large family who likes to take trips. If she could visit anywhere in the world, she would like to visit Tennessee.</p>
<p>When not reading, you can find Jayvonna enjoying the indoors and outdoors. She likes to play basketball, laugh, dance and enjoys spending time with her friends. She also has an eye for fashion and enjoys going to the mall shopping for shoes, clothe, and dresses.</p>
<p>Math is her favorite subject and she earns A’s and B’s in school while keeping up on helping around the house by cleaning her bathroom and completing other chores.</p>
<p>She likes Disney movies such as <i>Cinderella</i> and <i>Mulan</i>. This beautiful sweet young lady loves cats and dogs, but doesn’t see herself going into the animal care field when she grows up. She does know that when she is an adult, whatever she does for a living will be in addition to being a mom.</p>
