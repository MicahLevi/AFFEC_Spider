            <h2>Meet Chrissiya</h2>
            <h4>Born November 2001</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Chrissiya2Aug2016small.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4411" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/Chrissiya2Aug2016small.jpg" alt="Chrissiya2Aug2016small" width="542" height="388"></a> Chrissiya is one energetic teenager. She has a lot of hobbies which keep her busy. It’s easy to figure out that gym is Chrissiya’s favorite part of school when you see her list of extracurricular activities. She plays basketball, football, and does gymnastics and cheerleading. Even when she plays video games, she prefers Wii games where she can get up and dance around.</p>
<p>When she isn’t playing sports, Chrissiya likes to go to Kings Island, Dave and Buster’s or go shopping. She likes movies.Music is a big part of Chrissiya’s life. She enjoys rap music and she likes to sing gospel as well as listen to it. Her favorite musicians at the moment are the members of Mindless Behavior, an R&B boy band.<a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/ChrissiyaAug2016small.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4412 alignright" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/ChrissiyaAug2016small.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="585"></a></p>
<p>When she grows up, she has said she wants to become a foster parent herself and provide homes for kids in need.</p>
<p>Since Chrissiya is a very active young girl, a family that can keep up and plan a lot of activities as a family would be perfect. She needs a family who will encourage her to continue being a charming, respectful young woman while also teaching her how to positively express herself.</p>
