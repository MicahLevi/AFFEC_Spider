            <h4>Born July 1999</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/mpkyhahnsp212-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1309 alignright" src="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/mpkyhahnsp212-08.jpg" alt="mpkyhahnsp212-08" width="232" height="350" srcset="https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/mpkyhahnsp212-08.jpg 2136w, https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/mpkyhahnsp212-08-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.hckids.org/wp-content/uploads/mpkyhahnsp212-08-680x1024.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></a>Ky’Mahn prefers to be called “Key”- that’s what his friends call him. Key is a laid back kid with an eye for coordinating his attire. When possible, Key says it is important to match your clothes to your shoes. So his red or blue shirt will definitely go with his Nike’s or Jordan’s.</p>
<p>This energetic young man is happiest when he is running track, playing sports or playing with his friends after school. He runs the 400 on his track team and plays quarterback and wide receiver on his football team. Besides being an outstanding athlete, Key loves to read books. He says his current favorite books are the <em>Chicken Soup for the Soul</em> series. Key likes video games with fighting and scary movies. Key says he might want to use his skills to be a policeman or a football player when he grows up.</p>
<p>A family who likes participating in lots of activities would be a fantastic positive influence on this young man. Key would do well with parents who will support him and keep him busy.</p>
