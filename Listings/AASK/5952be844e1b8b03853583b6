                            <p lang="en">Cody enjoys school and loves seeing his teachers and classmates every day. He will be in the 9th grade. In 8th grade, he was integrated in a regular classroom setting, but had an aide. Cody has an IEP in place.  Cody is very popular at school and has a lot of friends!</p>
                            <p lang="en">Cody needs to be the only child in the home, or in a home with boys close to his age. He would thrive in a two parent home with a family who is familiar with his special needs, or willing to learn how to care for him. He would love a home with animals he could help care for as he enjoys animals and is great with them. He will need to continue his services both at school and in the home. </p>
