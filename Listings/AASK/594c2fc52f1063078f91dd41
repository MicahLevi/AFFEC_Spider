                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/amerikiss-thumb.jpg" alt="Amerikiss" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Amerikiss is a friendly blonde hair and blue eyed five year old, with a contagious smile and laugh. Amerikiss can be very loving and will display affection through "I love yous" and hugs.  She can get dressed by herself, assists with brushing her teeth and putting on her shoes, makes her own bed and likes to brush her hair. She has a very imaginative mind and loves to play dress up. Amerikiss enjoys playing with dolls, swinging on the swings, playing outside, going on walks, coloring and being read to. Her favorite foods are pizza and hot dogs.</p>

                            <p lang="en">Amerikiss will be in kindergarten in the fall and has an IEP in place.</p>
                            <p lang="en">The best fit family for Amerikiss would be a one or two parent home, where she is the only child or the youngest child. While initially fearful of pets, she will do well with pets after she can warm up to them. She needs constant supervision, routine and re-direction. Amerikiss will do well given the structure, love, affection and attention that she truly deserves.</p>
