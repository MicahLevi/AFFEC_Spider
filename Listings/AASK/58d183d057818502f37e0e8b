It makes 13-year-old Nelly laugh out loud with joy.<br><br>The dark-haired teen is pretty happy anyway, but she is beaming – and laughing from time to time – as she focuses on painting a smiling cupcake, a portrait of blue and pink. Cheryl Tisland, owner and instructor of Burst of Butterflies Create and Paint Studios in downtown Chandler, guides Nelly step by step from blank canvas to finished work of art. And Nelly is a focused student.<br><br>Painting and drawing are her favorite pastimes, Nelly says. She also enjoys singing, dance and hiking in the desert.</p>

                            <p lang="en">“Nelly is very polite,” says Brianna Rossi, a Wendy’s Wonderful Kids adoption recruiter with Aid to Adoption of Special Kids (AASK). “She can be shy, but loves to engage people when they ask her questions.”<br><br>Nelly enjoys school and will be in the eighth grade this coming academic year. She has special learning needs being met through an individual education plan, Rossi says.<br><br>“Nelly would thrive in a two-parent family with parents who have experience with children in foster care, or experience raising their own biological children,” says Rossi.</p>
                            <p lang="en">“She’ll do well in a home with other children – younger children or older children,” Rossi says, adding that Nelly also loves pets.<br><br>Nelly does best with a structured routine in which next steps are clearly explained and she knows what to expect, Rossi says.<br><br>At Burst of Butterflies, having each step explained allowed Nelly to produce a cupcake painting good enough to eat.</p>
