He likes to play point guard because the position’s role is to help others score.<br><br>

His favorite professional basketball team is the Golden State Warriors “because they don’t give up and they help each other a lot.”</p>

                            <p lang="en">Jersiaah says he wants to be a pro basketball player, but knows that is a long shot.<br><br>

“If I can’t be a pro basketball player, I would join the Army,” he says, adding that he wants to join the Army because “you help the U.S.A.”
Caring for others comes naturally to Jersiaah, says adoptions recruiter Victoria Celaya.<br><br>

“He is very caring and protective of those close to him, and I think that is why he has the goal of one day being in the Army,” she says.
Jersiaah is a disciplined student who has made great progress within the last six months, Celaya says.</p>
                            <p lang="en">“Jersiaah really enjoys school,” she says. “He enjoys the challenges and expectations set for him.”<br><br>

Jersiaah loves to read outside the classroom and especially likes books about animals. His favorite animal is the wolverine.<br><br>

He likes caring for the dogs living in his foster home, taking them on long walks through his neighborhood.<br><br>

Jersiaah’s caring nature makes him a great fit for a two-parent family with siblings, says Celaya.<br><br>

“Jersiaah would bloom in a family where he could be a big brother and I think he would appreciate those responsibilities,” she says.</p>
