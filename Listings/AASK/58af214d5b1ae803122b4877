He is very active and loves to dance! Some of Gabriel's interests are playing on the trampoline, playing with toy cars, puzzles, play-DOH, video games, arts and crafts and baking! Gabriel really enjoys assisting in baking cookies and cakes for dessert. Gabriel also enjoys anything "transformer" related," such as books, videos and toys. </p>

                            <p lang="en">There is currently an IEP in place in Gabriel's kindergarten class, for behaviors.</p>
                            <p lang="en">Gabriel will do best in a two parent home, with a strong male role model. Gabriel will do well with older children in the home and will need supervision, with any pets in the home. He will need a family with consistent daily routines, clear expectations and consequences for his actions. Gabriel will need twenty-four hour supervision. A family that would fit best for Gabriel is one that is active and allows for provision of a lot of physical movement. He will also do best in a home that has a good sense of humor, a lot of love and patience.  </p>
