                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/luis-thumb.jpg" alt="Luis" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Luis, an 13-year-old boy who has been in the Arizona foster care system for several years, is this week’s featured Wednesday’s Child. During his interview and activity session, he was able to live the dream of playing football with Sun Devil quarterback Brady White and running back Nick Ralston at Arizona State’s Verde Dickey Dome.<br><br>Imagine his infinite smile when the players compared him to his favorite football player, Calvin Johnson, because of his speed and ability to catch passes so well. Luis would like to be a wide receiver in the NFL someday. But if that dream doesn’t quite pan out, he has a backup plan.</p>

                            <p lang="en">“If I can’t play football when I get older, I want to help pets find homes, because some cats and dogs are strays and they need a home, too,” said Luis, who has a special affinity toward dogs, perhaps because they can offer the unconditional love that he longs for.<br><br>Luis is a happy kid who loves to sing. He has an amazing smile that lights up a room. He’s a very helpful young man and always wants to make sure he does tasks, like sweeping and cleaning the table, the right way. He thrives with positive reinforcement.<br><br>Luis knows he needs good grades to be able to do the things he wants in life, so he’s doing well so far. “My favorite subject in school is social studies, and my grades are good. I like to learn about the history of the Civil War and the freedom from slavery. I find it inspiring. I like to learn what happened in the past before I was born,” he said. </p>
                            <p lang="en">Luis needs a family that will take the time to help him be a kid. He needs parents and possibly siblings to play catch, board games and video games with him. They should be patient, loving and kind, and provide him with the security that only a forever family can.<br><br>“An ideal family for Luis is one that takes the time to teach him life skills, like riding a bike, which he hasn’t had the opportunity to learn. He needs someone that can be there for him to be sure he’s brushing his teeth, like you would for a younger child,” said Jessica Johnson, Luis’s DCS case manager. “He never got that direction when he was young so he needs it now. He has a lot of potential and unfortunately nobody has given him the time he needs.”<br><br>This kid, who loves enchiladas and singing in the bathroom, offers a family joy and requited love. His light shines bright as he makes his way through his triumphs and hardships with an infectious smile on his face.</p>
