                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/rebekkah-thumb.jpg" alt="Rebekkah" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Fourteen-year-old Rebekkah is normally bubbly, talkative and outgoing. But sitting at a table at the As You Wish pottery painting studio in Chandler, the teen is quiet as a church mouse and focused as a surgeon as she works.<br><br>

With the help of instructor Liz Geoghan, Rebekkah paints a giraffe as part of the decoration.<br><br>

Rebekkah, it turns out, has a thing for giraffes.<br><br>

Rebekkah – Becky to her friends – had a chance to feed a giraffe during a recent visit to the Phoenix Zoo and giraffes have since replaced penguins as the focus of her fascination, says James Schlemmer, a youth advocate with Christian Family Care.</p>

                            <p lang="en">Becky, who has mild cognitive delays, was thrilled to get a stuffed pink giraffe for Christmas, Schlemmer says.<br><br>

But, she still loves penguins. <br><br>

Mostly, though, Becky is a people person, says Schlemmer.<br><br>

“She loves to engage with people,” he says. “Friends are very important to her.”<br><br>

Becky’s favorite class is PE because it gives her a chance to socialize.<br><br>

Becky is in eighth grade and looking forward to high school, Schlemmer says.<br><br>

“She is really thriving in school,” he says, noting that her academic performance has improved significantly over the past two years.</p>
                            <p lang="en">At home, Becky “likes to draw – that’s her favorite thing,” Schlemmer says.<br><br>

Her art is often a display of her sense of humor, Schlemmer adds.<br><br>

“She might draw a penguin, but put a giraffe’s head on it,” he says.<br><br>

Becky would do well in a forever family with one parent or one with two parents.<br><br>

“The key for her is structure,” Schlemmer says. “She thrives when she knows what to expect.”<br><br>

Becky “connects with younger children easily” and would do well in a family in which she has siblings, Schlemmer says.</p>
