                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/darryl-thumb.jpg" alt="Darryl" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Darryl is an energetic 15-year-old boy who loves fire trucks, car rides, balloons and the outdoors. <br><br>This happy young man enjoys starting his day early to help his foster family in any way he can, whether it be household chores or other daily routines. He has a sentimental spirit and genuinely cares about others.<br><br>Darryl is a hands-on kid and an avid explorer of life. He is smart and enjoys going to school, where he makes consistent progress and brings home positive daily notes from his teachers,” explains Rayleen Carangio, Darryl’s recruiter from Wendy’s Wonderful Kids at St. Nicholas Center.</p>

                            <p lang="en">He attends a school that works with his personal needs and is currently learning how to use his new augmented communication device. “If you spend a lot of time with Darryl, you will see that you understand him just fine, and you will find your own little language with him.”<br><br>Bright, upbeat and full of energy, this teenager just wants a place to call home. A two-parent household (or a single parent who has a lot of energy) is the ideal family environment for Darryl. He requires a fair amount of supervision and benefits from a lot of love and support to help him learn and grow as he matures. “A family that is willing to give Darryl a lot of love and comes into the idea of being a forever family with a pretty open mind, a lot of humor and enthusiasm is important,” said Carangio.</p>
                            <p lang="en">Having one family for the rest of his life will make a huge difference in Darryl’s progress. One family that gets to know the school that he’s going to and that is his eternal advocate is going to be life changing for Darryl as he grows and matures.<br><br>In the future, Darryl will be the type of man who will probably stay home or live in some sort of assisted living. He will need a lot of love and support throughout his adulthood. If his recruiter could guess what he’d want to have as a career, it would be a fireman, considering he loves loud sirens, fire trucks and trips to the fire station.<br><br>Darryl especially enjoys playing outside, particularly on swing sets. He loves swimming and anything made of chocolate – specifically ice cream.</p>
