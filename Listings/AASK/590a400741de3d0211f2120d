                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/blake-thumb.jpg" alt="Blake" class="img-responsive profilePic" />The bright red Mustang looks – and sounds – is just a muscle car to most folks. But, for 11-year-old Blake sitting in the driver’s seat, it is heaven on Earth.<br><br>

Blake likes cars. No, Blake <em>loves</em> cars.<br><br>

“Cars are his thing,” says Heather Riffle, a youth advocate with Christian Family Care.<br><br>

The good-humored fourth-grader is grinning ear-to-ear as he enjoys a private tour of the Martin Auto Museum in north Phoenix, a collection of more than 60 automobiles. While the vehicles on display include a 1922 Chevy Sport Roadster and a 1930 J-249 Duesenburg Boattail, it’s the 21st Century muscle cars that draw Blake.</p>

                            <p lang="en">“When I grow up, I want to work here,” Blake says, only half joking.<br><br>

As you might expect, Blake wants a career that has something do with cars when he is an adult.<br><br>

Blake says he is looking forward to going to college and does well in school now.<br><br>

“I’m good at math – expect division is kind of hard,” he says.<br><br>

Blake says he hopes a forever family will help him with his school work “and help me get better at reading.”<br><br>

When out of the classroom, Blake says he likes to stay active and outside.</p>
                            <p lang="en">“I don’t like watching sports on TV,” he says. “I like playing sports.”<br><br>

A forever family that will help Blake stay busy in sports leagues would be a great match, says Riffle. “Blake loves to be outside,” she says.<br><br>

Blake would do well in a single parent or a two parent household in which he is the youngest child, says Riffle.<br><br>

“It would be best if he was with someone willing to help him get caught up in his school work,” Riffle says.</p>
