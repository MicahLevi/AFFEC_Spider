                            <p lang="en">Seven year old Adonnis and his four year old sister Adianna will bring a family a lot of laughs, smiles and activity! These two are full of energy and will keep a family on their toes! Adonnis enjoys playing basketball and is quite good at it, he also enjoys having books read to him. Adianna has a wonderful laugh and enjoys being pampered, she especially enjoys having her nails painted. The siblings enjoy bike rides, playing on a trampoline and going to the park. </p>
                            <p lang="en">Adonnis will be entering the second grade, next academic school year and Adianna will enter kindergarten. </p>
                            <p lang="en">Adianna and Adonnis would do well in a two-parent home. Both of the children require a lot of attention and redirection and a two-parent family would be best able to meet their needs. Adonnis and Adianna would do best in a home with older children or no other children. The children will require a family who is structured and sets boundaries, immediately. An active family would be wonderful for these children.</p>
