                            <p lang="en">Jenna will be in 8th grade.  She enjoys going to school for the social part of it, but also enjoys Math and Science.  Jenna would like to attend Arizona State University and would love to be a nurse or a day care provider as she enjoys caring for younger children.</p>
                            <p lang="en">Jenna would love to have a mom and a dad and a few siblings. She would likely do best in a home with older children, preferably female, that she could learn from and wouldn’t have to fight with for her parent’s attention. She would like an active family who will want to do activities with her. Jenna needs a family who is patient and consistent with her; they will need to be structured, but allow her some independence to learn who she really is.  Jenna needs people in her life that will provide her with love and attention as she longs to be loved and included in a family of her own.</p>
