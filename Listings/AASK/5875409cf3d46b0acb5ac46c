                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/taylor-thumb.jpg" alt="Taylor" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Sixteen-year-old Taylor is good with his hands – whether he is holding drumsticks or a wrench.<br><br>

During a guitar lesson with instructor Sam Sultan at Scottsdale Music Academy, Taylor goes from strumming a six-string to pounding a drum kit – and sounding pretty good at it.<br><br>

And he has never had formal lessons. He acquired his musical skills through osmosis hanging out with musicians and by watching YouTube videos<br><br>

“I like to learn new things,” Taylor says.</p>

                            <p lang="en">He recently built a BMX bicycle and does repairs to keep it rolling.<br><br>

“He has always been into tools,” says Tabitha, Taylor’s adult sister. “He is very hands-on.”<br><br>

Tabitha, who entered the foster care system when Taylor did, has aged out of the system.<br><br>

Taylor is a high school sophomore and benefits from an individualized education plan.<br><br>

“I’m sure out there are a couple of kids who like school,” Taylor deadpans, “but I’m not one of them.”<br><br>

But he quickly adds that he works hard and cooperates with his teachers. Doing well in school is an important step in reaching his career goals.</p>
                            <p lang="en">“I’ve been wanting to be a firefighter since I was about four years old,” Taylor says.<br><br>

Firefighters help people, Taylor says, and that appeals to him.
That choices suits Taylor’s personality, says Tabitha. “He is protective of every one he cares about,” she says.<br><br>

His protective nature means Taylor would do well in forever family with younger children, says Brianna Rossi, a Wendy’s Wonderful Kids adoption recruiter with Aid to Adoption of Special Kids (AASK).<br><br>

Taylor says he wants his forever family to be comfortable with him maintaining his relationships with members of his biological family. Tabitha also hopes for that in Taylor’s forever family.<br><br>

“He has a niece,” Tabitha says, “and she very much loves him.”</p>
