                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/ladavia-thumb.jpg" alt="Ladavia" class="img-responsive profilePic" />In a time of hand-held video games and smartphones with streaming video, 13-year-old Ladavia prefers the refuge found in an old-fashioned ink-on-paper book.<br><br>

“If I don’t want to go outside and just be lazy, I read,” she says. “It takes you to another world.”<br><br>

The eighth-grader says she likes the “Twilight” series of vampire-themed fantasy romance novels and the romance novels of author Nicholas Sparks.</p>

                            <p lang="en">Her preference for romance extends to movies, she says.<br><br>

“I don’t like scary movies,” Ladavia says.<br><br>

Ladavia doesn’t just consume art, she creates it, too. She loves to draw in the subdued blacks and grays of pencil and in the bold colors of street art.<br><br>

“I like graffiti – that’s my favorite art,” she says.<br><br>

But, don’t get the impression Ladavia is a couch potato.<br><br>

“I want to go skydiving,” she says. “I want to go bungee jumping.”</p>
                            <p lang="en">For now, she gets her thrills skateboarding. During a lesson with Timothy Ward, program director of the youth program Skate After School, Ladavia zipped down ramps at a Gilbert skate park and she learned a couple of new tricks, too.<br><br>

She is learning at school, too.<br><br>

“My grades are pretty good,” she says, adding “I actually love my school.”<br><br>

Ladavia says she is already looking forward to going to college.<br><br>

Being part of a forever family will help her reach that goal, she says.<br><br>

“I don’t care what sort of forever family I have as long as they like me for who I am.”</p>
