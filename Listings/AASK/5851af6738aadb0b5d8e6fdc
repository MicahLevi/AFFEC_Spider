                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/aaronandrew-thumb.jpg" alt="Aaron & Andrew" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Aaron and Andrew are brothers, sure, but they are also a team.<br><br>

“We work a lot better together,” says 15-year-old Andrew. “We encourage each other each other to do the right stuff.”<br><br>

Aaron agrees.<br><br>

“I do a lot better when I’m with Andrew,” says 13-year-old Aaron.</p>

                            <p lang="en">Aaron says his older brother is “very nice and caring” and a steadying influence.<br><br>

“I know that when I’m upset I can always go to my brother and he helps me calm down,” says Aaron.<br><br>

While they rely on each other for support, Aaron and Andrew like to do their own thing.<br><br>

Andrew, the older of the two teens, loves to play football. He roots for the Ohio State Buckeyes and dreams of playing football for the team.<br><br>

Aaron, while a big fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, is satisfied to have his football career end with his Pop Warner youth football league days.<br><br>

Both like watching television, but its Aaron who really likes playing video games. Both teens like riding bicycles and swimming. Andrew enjoys playing basketball, in addition to football.</p>
                            <p lang="en">Both teens enjoy going to school – as much as any boy does.<br><br>

“Some days I like school and some days I don’t,” Aaron says.<br><br>

The brothers have their eyes on action-packed careers that help others. Aaron wants to be a SWAT team member.<br><br>

“They help out more than other police officers can,” he says.<br><br>

Andrews wants to join the military and work with bomb-sniffing dogs.<br><br>

While they want different careers, Aaron and Andrews are looking for the same things in a forever family. Both would like a two-parent household with a mother and a father.<br><br>

“I would be good with siblings,” Aaron says.<br><br>

Andrew says he would also like to join a family with younger children so that he could be a role model.<br><br>

What is most important, both brothers say, is that they’re together.</p>
