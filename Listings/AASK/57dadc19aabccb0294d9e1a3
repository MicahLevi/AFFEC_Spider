This shy 9 year old will warm up quickly when the topic turns to his favorite subjectâ€”video games!  Also a fan of soccer and football, Dameon would one day love to grow up to be a professional soccer player for Argentina. </p>

                            <p lang="en">Currently in the 4th grade, Dameon enjoys school and excels at math and reading.  Dameon states that he likes doing projects, and he has an IEP to help him out in the classroom.  Dameon loves the Avengers movies, and wants an active family with a dog and older brothers and sisters.</p>
                            <p lang="en">Dameon will do best in a two-parent family with no younger children.  He needs consistent structure and firm boundaries, as well as a parenting team that shares discipline responsibilities equally.  Dameon will be most successful in a family that can create a set schedule and clear expectations, and will require committed adults that will give him time to build trust.</p>
