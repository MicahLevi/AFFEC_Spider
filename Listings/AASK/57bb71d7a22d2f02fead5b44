                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/kanin-thumb.jpg" alt="Kanin" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Kanin is a 17-year-old animal lover who got a chance to play with over 20 kittens at the Arizona Animal Welfare League during his Wednesday’s Child video shoot. “I just fell in love with them. One of the kittens was on my shoulder nibbling on my ear and was a little feisty. That’s why I liked him. I’d never been around little kittens before,” he said.<br><br>The kittens weren’t the only animals that had him all smiles and laughs. He also had a good time playing with snakes and dogs, which are his favorite. He was very gentle with all of the animals.</p>

                            <p lang="en">It comes as no surprise that Kanin wants to be a veterinarian or veterinarian’s assistant when he gets older. But he has many other interests, as well. He could also see himself as a video game designer and tester. He’s a very well-rounded kid.<br><br>Kanin loves animals, video games, Star Wars, music, telling jokes and super heroes.<br><br>“From DC Comics, my favorite superhero is Batman. From Marvel, I like Wolverine and Deadpool,” he said. “If I could have any super power, I’d pick rapid healing, teleportation and mad skills with weaponry.”<br><br>School is going good for Kanin. One of his favorite classes is English (he said he also likes weightlifting and lunch – ha ha). “I like English because we read a book and then watch the movie that goes to the book.”<br><br>Music is also very important to Kanin. He likes to explore new rock bands and appreciates classic rock. His favorites are Queen, Aerosmith, Van Halen and Guns N’ Roses. </p>
                            <p lang="en">Kanin is boisterous, with a great sense of humor. He loves to talk about his interests, and he engages easily with adults. He is open and resilient, and he desperately wants a family.<br><br>When asked what type of family Kanin would like, he got very serious and said, “I would like a family that loves animals. One that is loving, caring and trustworthy.” He said he would offer a family the same qualities along with respect.<br><br>If he could, he would like to have a dog and a cat. Maybe two dogs once he gets the hang of taking care of the first. Kanin realizes it’s a lot of work to have an animal and he is willing to do everything he has to do to keep it healthy and happy.<br><br>Kanin has been in the foster care system for way too long. He’s had to switch families, schools and lives since 2004. This kid will be so happy with the opportunity to join a forever family. He knows he has a lot to offer. “If someone were to describe me, they would say I’m caring, strong, funny and creative. I also have a good memory and a great sense of humor,” said Kanin.</p>
