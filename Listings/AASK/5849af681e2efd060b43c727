                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/nasia-thumb.jpg" alt="Nasia" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Like a lot of teens, Nasia’s attention sometimes flits about, so it was fitting she chose to draw a butterfly during a lesson with artist and educator Kyllan Maney at the Mesa Arts Center.<br><br>

Together, the two worked with colored pencils to draw a colorful butterfly on a Shrinky Dinks sheet, a plastic sheet that shrinks and thickens into a hardened plastic plate when baked in a toaster oven.<br><br>

Nasia, 15, has a moderate cognitive disability and her focus does sometime wander, says Brianna Rossi, a Wendy’s Wonderful Kids adoption recruiter with Aid to Adoption of Special Kids (AASK).</p>

                            <p lang="en">“But, if you say to her, ‘I need help with this,’ she is happy to pitch right in,” Rossi says.<br><br>

Nasia is in ninth grade and “really enjoys school,” Rossi says. “She loves routine.”<br><br>

At home, Nasia loves playing card games and piecing puzzles together. She has recently become intrigued while playing with magnets. Nasia also loves watching DVDs, says Rossi.<br><br>

Nasia also likes playing softball.<br><br>

The teen would thrive in a family with younger children, Rossi says.</p>
                            <p lang="en">“Nasia does amazing with younger children,” Rossi says.<br><br>

She is very loving and nurturing with younger children, Rossi adds.<br><br>

“For example, she loves to greet her foster sister at the door after school,” Rossi says.<br><br>

Nasia would do best in a forever home of any family composition, Rossi says, as long as there is a strong mother figure.<br><br>

“Nasia will need care long term and she will need a family there to support her for the long term,” Rossi says.</p>
