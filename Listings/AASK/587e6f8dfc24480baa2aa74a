There is measuring fabric, cutting the fabric and stitching seams. Fortunately, 11-year-old Kimberly has an abundance of focus as Naomi Ellis, a fashion design instructor at Phoenix College, guides her through the construction of a purple skirt.<br><br>While the session was Kimberly’s first time sewing, it wasn’t the first time she has made something with her hands. She likes to keep herself busy with all sorts of arts and craft projects.<br><br>“I like to play and goof around and color, too” she adds.</p>
