Sometimes, I draw trees or mountains or cactus.”<br><br>Reading also allows him to tap into his imagination, as do Legos.<br><br>“Elijah is especially creative with Legos,” says Nicole Hylton, a Wendy’s Wonderful Kids recruiter at St. Nicholas Adoption Center. “When he puts Lego pieces together, he has an innate sense of where everything fits.”</p>
