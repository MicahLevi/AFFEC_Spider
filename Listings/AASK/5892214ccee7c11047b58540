                            <p lang="en">Jaydien loves building new worlds with Lego bricks and says he dreams of visiting LEGOLAND.<br><br>"I do like origami too," he adds. “You take a piece of paper and you fold it and fold it and fold it.”<br><br>”Jaydien loves using his imagination," says Jen Workman, a youth advocate at Arizona’s Children Association.<br><br>He also likes video games, swimming and jumping on a trampoline, says Workman.<br><br>"Jaydien has a huge personality and he is a bright kid," says Workman.<br><br>He is adjusting to moving to a new school.</p>
                            <p lang="en">"Jaydien is extremely intelligent, yet he is still catching up (academically) due to his past experiences," Workman says. "He needs a parent, or parents, who will offer a lot of positive reinforcement and encouragement because he, at times gets, frustrated when he encounters challenges."<br><br>Jaydien needs to find a forever home in Arizona and would do best in a family in which he is the youngest child, Workman says.<br><br>"Jaydien is making huge strides and is quickly coming out of his shell at his current group home," Workman says. "But with the love of a family, his growth and progress would skyrocket."</p>
