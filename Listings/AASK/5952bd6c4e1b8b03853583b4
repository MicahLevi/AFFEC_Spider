                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/alexis-thumb.jpg" alt="Alexis" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Meet 11-year-old Alexis (Lexie)! Lexie can be very athletic, but is also a girly-girl. She enjoys swimming, riding bikes, playing soccer, going to the movies and shopping. Lexieâ€™s favorite foods include pizza, breadsticks, hot pockets, and spaghetti. She loves going out to eat at Golden Corral, Olive Garden and Peter Piper Pizza. She enjoys listening to rap music. She describes herself as athletic, weird, and funny. </p>

                            <p lang="en">Lexie will be in 5th grade. She does very well in school, though she claims she does not like it. She does have an IEP in place. Lexie would like to be a teacher, a swim instructor, or a nurse when she grows up.</p>
                            <p lang="en">Lexie will do well in any family setting, such as a two parent home or a single parent. She does require a lot of attention and needs structure, consistency, and commitment. Lexie would do well as an only child or in a home with fewer children, so that she can have the attention she desires from a family. Lexie would thrive in a family that is active and would spend quality time with her hiking, riding bikes, or playing sports. </p>
