                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/giovanni-thumb.jpg" alt="Giovanni" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Fourteen-year-old Giovanni loves to build new worlds.<br><br>

He has been working on a hand-built model city for at least three years, crafting houses and office buildings out of wood and cardboard, laying out streets and highways. Giovanni – who goes by the nickname Gio – says he is presently trying to figure out how to light the miniature metropolis so that it comes alive after dark.<br><br>

“His imagination is really working a lot,” says foster parent Jon Cabungcal.</p>

                            <p lang="en">Gio’s imagination is fueled by his fascination with real cities – the skyscrapers, the highways, the busy sidewalks. He studies photographs and maps. He memorizes street names.<br><br>

“My favorite city is New York City,” he says. “Even though I haven’t been there.”<br><br>

Gio also helps build digital worlds through Roblox, an online gaming platform where users create simulation games and role play. Gio participates regularly in the games and even has a job in a virtual sushi restaurant.<br><br>

“You pass the job interview by using great grammar,” Gio says.<br><br>

Not surprisingly, Gio says when he enters the adult world he’d like a career as a video game designer.</p>
                            <p lang="en">But, Gio’s passions extend beyond models and video games. He loves cats. An hour spent in a cat room with Dylan Kirkpatrickat Foothills Animal Rescue, an animal shelter in Scottsdale, was heaven on earth for the eighth grader.<br><br>

He says he would love it if the household of his forever family included a cat.<br><br>

“Gio would thrive in a home with two parents who can provide routine and structure,” says Brianna Rossi, a Wendy’s Wonderful Kids adoption recruiter with Aid to Adoption of Special Kids (AASK). “He needs to know what’s coming next.”</p>
