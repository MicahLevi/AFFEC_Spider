                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/jorge-thumb.jpg" alt="Jorge" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Jorge is very calm. And a little bit fearless.<br><br>
Carefully positioned and mic’d up for a television interview, Jorge focused on the questions and his answers as a bee crawled on his bare arm. Repeated efforts by the crew to shoo away the bee failed. The bee returned time and again to explore Jorge’s skin.<br><br>
The sixth-grader was unflappable throughout.<br><br>
Did he consider swatting the bee?</p>

                            <p lang="en">“No,” Jorge says, smiling. “The bee is very little and I’m very big.”
Besides, he adds, “I do love bees because they make us honey and they make our flowers grow beautiful.”<br><br>
His love of bees is in keeping with Jorge’s love of the outdoors.  His favorite sports are baseball and football. He enjoys doing landscaping chores around the house.<br><br>
“I like to work with my hands,” Jorge says. “I like being creative with my hands.”<br><br>
That hands-on creativity extends from the backyard, where he likes to build clubhouses, to the classroom, where he likes to build science projects.<br><br>
“There was this pretty cool project I did at school,” Jorge says. “ It was this science project and it was about making a castle out of cups and napkins.”</p>
                            <p lang="en">Jorge says science is his favorite subject in school.<br><br>
“When I grow up, I really want to be an engineer in the Navy,” he says.<br><br>
Jorge is hoping to soon find a forever family that will help him grow up to be an engineer.<br><br>
“I would like my forever family to be a mom that really cares about me,” he says. “And I’ll take care of her.”<br><br>
Jorge says he would prefer to be an only child.<br><br>
Jorge is bi-lingual and says he would like to be in a home where he can speak English and Spanish.<br><br>
Oh, and one more thing.<br><br>
“The thing I really like,” Jorge says, “is fashion and hair styles and brands of shoes.”</p>
