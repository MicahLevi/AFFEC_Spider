                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/abriannaserenity-thumb.jpg" alt="Abrianna & Serenity" class="img-responsive profilePic" />“What makes us happy is being together,” said Abrianna, one of two sisters featured on this week’s Wednesday’s Child.  Abrianna and Serenity are sweet little girls who are very close and will need to be adopted together. The sisters, who love to dance, were treated to a private dance and movement class with teacher Emily Alvarez at Dance 101.<br><br>

Abrianna, the older of the two, tends to be very motherly to her younger sister. Serenity, who is working on her cognitive development, is very clear when it comes to how much she loves her big sis. “She looks out for me. She’s my superhero. She’s the best!”<br><br>

The bond between these sisters is strong and they enjoy doing activities together. Besides dancing, they love to sing, play on their bikes and scooters, and have books read to them. They also like to go to the movies and to church. </p>

                            <p lang="en">Nine year-old Abrianna is caring, enthusiastic, and competitive. She’s fun and quirky and loves to tell jokes. Doing her best is important to her. Eight year-old Serenity is funny, silly and excitable. She loves giving big hugs and will cuddle up with you for movie time. It can take her a little longer to warm up in social situations until she gets used to her surroundings.<br><br>

Both girls love animals and plan on being zookeepers when they grow up. Serenity loves horses and has a fish named Dory. Abrianna especially loves dogs and cats.</p>
                            <p lang="en">Laura Krall, who has been their foster mom for two years, described how positive and helpful the girls are. “They bring a lot of love and energy into our lives. We have a structured home which benefits the girls. They love helping around the house. Serenity is our little vacuumer, while Abrianna loves to wash the windows. They help with some of the cooking, take care of their plates after a meal, and keep their bedroom clean and organized,” she said.<br><br>

When it comes to a forever family, they both will require specialized long-term care, particularly Serenity. “They need a family with a strong foundation of love, consistency and patience. They just want to be loved and are open to sharing that love as well. Both girls would thrive in a two-parent household. They need a family who can be committed and dedicated to their needs and is excited about helping them grow developmentally, socially and emotionally. Having a forever family would help them heal and allow them to be the best children they can be,” said Krall. </p>
