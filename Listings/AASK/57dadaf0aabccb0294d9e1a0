“I’m a great helper,” he says, ticking off the chores he likes to do, including helping care for the chickens that are part of the menagerie at the foster home where he now lives. “I like helping out and doing family things.”<br><br>

Nicholaus likes caring for all the animals in the household – and there are quite a few.</p>

Does he have a favorite?<br><br>

“I like the tortoise because it’s so small and cute,” he says.<br><br>

Nicholaus also likes much bigger animals – horses. During a recent visit to Tyler Farms AZ in Mesa, riding instructor Scott Tyler and Nicholaus brushed the horses before mounting up for a lesson.<br><br>

“The horse was so calm,” Nicholaus says, adding that he enjoyed getting the horse to tro</p>
                            <p lang="en">Nicholaus also has a keen interest in all things mechanical and says he hopes his forever family has dirt bikes in the garage.<br><br>

Nicholaus works hard in school to please his teachers and says he hopes to go to college to become a police officer, firefighter or paramedic “because they save people’s lives.”<br><br>

Nicholaus hopes for a forever family that includes a mother and a father. He would do well with an active family that offers a strong male role model.</p>
