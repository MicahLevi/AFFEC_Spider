                            <p lang="en">Sports are a passion of 12-year- old Skyler. He likes football, basketball, soccer, baseball, swimming and running.<br><br>“At school, we had field day and we had a relay race and I was pretty much the fastest in the relay race,” he says.<br><br>Skyler also loves animals of almost every description.<br><br>“I like dogs, horses, geese and ducks,” he says.<br><br>When a magician visited his school this year, Skyler’s favorite part of the act was the magician’s sidekick.<br><br>“The magic guy brought a bunny to school and he let everybody pet it,” Skyler says, smiling at the recollection. “It was brown and fat.”</p>
                            <p lang="en">Skyler is a big fan of “The Voice,” the reality television singing competition, and of country star Blake Shelton, who is one of the judges on the program.<br><br>“It’s complicated,” he says of the show. “You never know what’s going to happen.”<br><br>Skyler will be in seventh grade this fall and likes math and science. He likes school so much, he’d like to be a teacher when he grows up.<br><br>Skyler enjoys being a member of a church.<br><br>“The reason I have faith is God knows that I’m here,” Skyler says. “I’m in His hands.”<br><br>Skyler says he would like a permanent family with a mother, father and siblings.
