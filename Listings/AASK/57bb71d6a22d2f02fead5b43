                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/justin-thumb.jpg" alt="Justin" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Justin likes to help people by fixing things.<br><br>

Made a mess of your homework? Justin will help you fix it.<br><br>

“I’m really good in math,” says the 16-year-old, “so if someone asks for help, I’ll help them.”<br><br>

Justin’s strength in math helps him in his favorite school subject – automobile mechanics. He is a natural at repairing cars – as his A’s in the class demonstrate. Justin says he wants to be an auto mechanic when he grows up because it’s a chance “to help people.”

                            <p lang="en">Justin love cars and he also has a soft spot for animals.<br><br>
“I like animals because sometimes people are mean to them and they have no defenses, so I like to help them out,” he says. He especially enjoys walking dogs and says he hopes to have a dog of his own one day.<br><br>
Right now, skateboarding is his favorite activity. Determination and a dose of fearlessness were evident during a skateboarding lesson with Marcus Johnson at Kids That Rip.<br><br<
“Justin was determined, he was committed and he was passionate about skateboarding,” says Marcus. “He just wanted to learn.”<br><br>
Justin also likes to ride his bike, shoot hoops, play football and work out. As a spectator, he is an avid Dallas Cowboys fan.</p>
                            <p lang="en">Justin is open to any home that offers love and stability, be it single-parent household or two-parent home. He says he would love “to have somebody I can talk to about stuff, to have fun going places, and to be active.”<br><br>
Justin says he would like being a big brother to younger siblings in his forever home. Setting down roots and being a part of a family, however, are what matters most.<br><br>
“It would be great not to move around all the time and have one place to stay, and to know it’s my forever home,” he says.</p>
