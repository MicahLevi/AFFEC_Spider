                            <p lang="en"><img src="../images/gallery/trystin-thumb.jpg" alt="Trystin" class="img-responsive profilePic" />Ten year old Trystin is full of life and energy. Trystin loves being outside, whether itâ€™s to play basketball, ride a bike or even just run around. Trystin enjoys being active but also has a calm and artistic side. He enjoys making sculptures out of pipe cleaners and making origami. He also enjoys watching movies. </p>

                            <p lang="en">Currently in the fifth grade, his favorite subjects are English and Math. There is an IEP in place. </p>
                            <p lang="en">A family for Trystin would need to be very committed and willing to work on building trust and attachment. He would do best in a two parent home, with either no children or younger children (especially infants and toddlers). Trystin requires a lot of individual attention and needs an active family, who is open and willing to try new and different things with him. He needs a structured home that also has the willingness and flexibility to grow and change together. </p>
