Damon says the most important thing he wants people to know is, “I’m smart and intelligent.” Indeed, he expresses his intellect when discussing the one place in the world he’d like to visit, which is either India or Asia. “They probably have wild animals there that I’ve never seen,” says Damon. He’s a deep thinker when discussing his favorite holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas, which he likes celebrating by giving and receiving presents. “There is good food on Thanksgiving,” he adds, “and it’s nice having everyone come together.” If he had three wishes, Damon would want enough money to help the homeless as well as charities with plenty left over to “keep for later use.” His career goal is to become “a fancy, cool car salesman.” But first, there’s a matter of enjoying his childhood by playing football and basketball. One of his favorite activities involves a youth group where the children all play games and sports while building social skills. When he’s asked what he wants families to know about him, Damon says, “I’m nice and cool!” Damon especially wants a family so they can spend time together doing things such as bike riding.<br/><br/>Damon has some challenging behaviors, but he is learning how to effectively manage and express his emotions in a consistent and positive manner. He would benefit from guidance on establishing and maintaining friendships with his peers as well as encouragement to improve his self-esteem. Damon has experienced a great deal of letdowns in his past and really needs a family to help him believe that he deserves a loving and stable home.<br/><br/>Damon would do best in a home with a mom and dad who can provide him structure, consistency and compassion. He is a very active child with a great deal of energy and would benefit from a family who can help channel his athleticism through positive means. Damon is in need of an adoptive family who will provide him with a patient and supportive home environment as he works to improve his self-esteem along with his emotional and behavioral responses to his daily frustrations. His family should ensure Damon receives the services he needs for his well-being. The family should be creative and flexible in their parenting style and techniques as Damon does best with consistent redirection and structure. Damon thrives with positive and individual attention and would do best in an adoptive home where he was the youngest or only child in the home.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C07919";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:13;s:4:"Race";s:5:"Black";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C07919.20170314.104441.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"03-14-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kiYFfTqf0pI";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C07919.20170314.104441.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
