When it’s warm, she likes playing on the swing set, and when it’s cold, she enjoys sloshing in the snow. Amber also loves going swimming. When she gets older, she wants to turn her love of the outdoors into a career by becoming a storm chaser. This lovable, sweet and inquisitive girl is outgoing, active and enjoys a good competition. In addition to outdoor activities, Amber enjoys playing with dolls, listening to music and reading books. One of Amber’s favorite things is her Lego Friends play sets. She particularly enjoys anything to do with Monster High and mermaids. Her list of favorite things includes pizza for food, bunny for animal, and pink and green for color. Her favorite subject in school is art. “Amber is very artistic and loves arts and crafts,” says her worker. “She has a silly personality and loves to tell and hear jokes.” One of the things she’d really love is a family who would take her places such as Disney World.<br/><br/>Amber has overcome a very difficult past and is learning how to manage her emotions regarding it. She can have difficulty understanding and respecting boundaries but “is improving in this area,” says her worker. Additionally, Amber is learning how to cope with her frustrations and establish a consistent daily routine. She thrives when others are very patient and able to give her one-on-one attention. Amber enjoys school and has a close bond with her teachers. <br/><br/>Amber would do best with a mother and father or a single-female parent who has a strong support network. Her new parent or parents would benefit from knowledge of the impact of trauma on a child’s behavior and development. Her new forever family also must be strong advocates for the services that Amber needs to thrive at home and in school. In addition, the family must be patient, understanding and encouraging, especially when Amber is transitioning into her new home. Her family also must provide the structure and supervision that will help Amber function at her best. “Amber would do well with siblings of any age;” her worker adds, “however, she would likely bond best with a younger sister who shares the same interests as her.” ";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C08055";s:6:"Gender";s:6:"Female";s:3:"Age";i:16;s:4:"Race";s:5:"White";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C08055.20170504.120751.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Qv8KvWixHdQ";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C08055.20170504.120751.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:0;s:8:"IsFemale";b:1;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
