For instance, he likes participating in sports, enjoys playing catch in his yard and looks forward to playing basketball after school. On many occasions, Hunter will entertain himself. He is most proud of his ability to pretend while playing and enjoys playacting as Power Rangers. “I want to be a Power Ranger,” says Hunter, “even though that’s not realistic.” Like a lot of kids, his favorite food is macaroni and cheese. His favorite colors are pink, purple, red and turquoise. With his forever family, Hunter hopes for another simple pleasure: to “have fun.” “I would like to have a family that knows what to do,” he adds. “Hopefully, they’ll tell me I look nice and stuff like that, and that they’re a really good family. And hopefully, they go to church.”<br/><br/>Due to his past, Hunter has difficulty appropriately expressing his emotions when he becomes frustrated. However, he receives services to help him cope with his feelings and recently developed a positive coping mechanism. At school, he benefits from additional patience and one-on-one support to help him reach his fullest potential. <br/><br/>The ideal family for Hunter would be resilient, patient, active and experienced in parenting. The family will need to provide Hunter with a loving and consistent home in which he can have reliable rules and structure. Hunter would do best in a two-parent family with at least on female caregiver. Hunter would do best with no other children in the home. His new family must be patient as Hunter adapts to his new home.  Additionally, his family must be strong advocates for the services Hunter needs to help him thrive now and into adulthood. Finally, his worker says Hunter’s family should focus on his strengths and “enjoy Hunter’s energy and sense of humor.”";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C08154";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:11;s:4:"Race";s:5:"White";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C08154.20170504.144954.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BgXQ-Yw3jlk";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C08154.20170504.144954.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
