He likes playing games on the weekend and when spending time with friends. Alvin lists games as something that makes him laugh and something that he wants to play with a forever family. If he could visit anywhere, Alvin would like to travel to Hollywood because “that’s where the celebrities are.” And perhaps they could give him tips on how to achieve his wishes: “to be famous and rich.” In addition to playing games, Alvin would like to go shopping and on trips with a forever family. The most important thing he wants people to know about him is, “I can be one of the kindest people when I want to be.” <br/><br/>Alvin is learning how to develop a consistent and reliable nighttime routine.  In addition, he is working on establishing positive outlets to express his emotions and is learning appropriate coping skills.  At school, he is working with assistance to reach his fullest potential and create a more effective way to complete his daily tasks. “He has worked diligently to improve in school,” his worker says.<br/><br/>Alvin needs an adoptive family who can provide him with patience and unconditional love in a home in which he is the youngest child. The family should have knowledge of the impact of trauma on a child’s development and behavior. Alvin would benefit from a two-parent family who would be committed to helping him reach his fullest potential. They should work with Alvin to develop positive coping skills. The family must be willing to continue and seek out any additional support services that would address his needs and well-being. It is very important to Alvin that he is able to maintain contact with his older siblings whom he is attached to.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C07409";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:14;s:4:"Race";s:5:"Black";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C07409.20160310.102525.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"03-10-2016";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LuZsMr5TRPU";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C07409.20160310.102525.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
