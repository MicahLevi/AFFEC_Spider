She dreams of becoming a lawyer one day and helping children. Autumn says she has a good role model to emulate for her philanthropic dreams. “I have a grandmother, and she travels the world,” says Autumn. “I look up to her … because she helps people, and I want to help people just like she helps people.” Of course, this outgoing and social girl keeps herself planted in the present as well by enjoying typical teen activities such as shopping, listening to music and going to the movies. One of her favorite activities involves pampering herself. “Autumn enjoys getting her hair and nails done professionally,” says her worker. Autumn also enjoys playing softball and joking around with her friends. Her list of favorites includes pizza for food and pink for color. When she finds her future forever family, Autumn wants to spend time together doing activities such as shopping, going to the movies and going out for family dinners. <br/><br/>Autumn has made much progress on expressing her feelings in an appropriate way. She is now able to recognize and verbalize how she can handle difficult situations in an appropriate manner. Her worker describes Autumn as “assertive, passionate and outspoken” about the things that are important to her, which include respect, privacy and family. “She is open and genuine in sharing her feelings after establishing trust,” the worker says.<br/><br/>Autumn wants a forever family who will accept her while allowing her time to transition into her new home. She will need experienced parents who will be patient with Autumn. Her new forever family must be strong advocates for the services that Autumn needs now and into adulthood. Those services should help Autumn thrive at home and at school. Since Autumn has a strong bond with her siblings and grandmother, her family must be willing to let her maintain those relationships.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C07620";s:6:"Gender";s:6:"Female";s:3:"Age";i:17;s:4:"Race";s:5:"Black";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C07620.20170504.123330.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xGam9zh2ppc";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C07620.20170504.123330.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:0;s:8:"IsFemale";b:1;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
