And, no, that team isn’t the Detroit Lions. “I would like to go to the NFL and star as a running back,” says Dionte. “I should be able to play on the Seattle Seahawks.” He might be on the right path because Dionte is considered a “go-getter” who really loves football (he plays nose tackle and lineman) and who has great athletic ability, something he takes the most pride in. He also is a brave kid who is not afraid to take a chance on new things. If he could visit anywhere, Dionte would travel to Atlanta because – in his words – “it looks and sounds like a lot of fun.” One of his workers describes Dionte as “a funny and smart guy” who serves as “a role model for younger children.” She adds that Dionte advocates for himself, that he has “exceptional problem solving and decision making skills” and that he’s mature beyond his age. On his list of favorite things, Dionte includes shrimp for food, red for color and tiger for animal. He likes playing computer and video games, particularly on the Xbox. On the weekends, he enjoys going outside for walks, riding his bike, rollerblading and playing sports. He’d like to do the same with a forever family.<br/><br/>Dionte can be quiet and introverted at times. He is more open and loving when he learns to trust new people. Dionte has difficulty managing instability in his life and benefits from a consistent and reliable home environment. He is worried about finding his adoptive family and can let that uncertainty affect his demeanor. At school, Dionte has had some difficulty with developing and maintaining positive peer relationships. He would benefit from a positive role model and encouragement to improve in this area. <br/><br/>Dionte needs an adoptive family who can provide him with love, structure, guidance and support. He would do well as the only or youngest child in a single-parent or two-parent home. The adoptive family must be willing to continue and seek out any support services that would benefit his well-being. In addition, the family must be willing to help Dionte maintain contact with appropriate relatives as these are very important relationships to him.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C07315";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:13;s:4:"Race";s:5:"Black";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C07315.20170504.142822.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xYLSD65gPxs";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C07315.20170504.142822.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
