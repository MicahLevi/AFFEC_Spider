Oh, he enjoys baseball, soccer and football, but basketball is his passion. And if the NBA career doesn’t work out, Antonio wants a job involving a court of another sort. He wants to become a police officer. Of course, Antonio loves being a kid and shows it by running around playing and laughing with friends. He has a great sense of humor and enjoys joking around with his friends. Antonio also likes listening to music and says gospel rap is his favorite genre. When asked about the qualities he wants in a forever family, Antonio says he hopes they’ll play sports and own a pet bunny. He adds that he simply wants a family who’s nice.<br/><br/>Due to the trauma he experienced, Antonio displays some challenging behavior, but he has shown recent improvement. In fact, a worker says that Antonio is “making positive decisions” and utilizing his coping resources when needed and has even been able to help peers when they are struggling. In school, Antonio reports that his favorite subject is math. He could use an advocate to make sure he gets the help he needs to thrive.<br/><br/>Antonio would do best in a two-parent forever family who can give him the attention that will help in his success at home and in school. Antonio also should be the only or youngest child in the home, but families with younger school-aged children may be considered. His family must be strong advocates for the services that Antonio needs to function at his best. The family will need to be very patient and supportive of Antonio as he learns to manage his emotions and build new and trusting relationships. Since Antonio loves animals, he wants a family who owns them, particularly horses and dogs. Lastly, Antonio really wants to be adopted with his brother Ni’Shawn (C07906), but if that’s not possible, his family must be willing to let him maintain contact with Ni’Shawn as well as his sister, Shantaina (C07907).";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C07908";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:12;s:4:"Race";s:5:"Black";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C07908.20170504.121744.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/zisdsGyjdco";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C07908.20170504.121744.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
