He loves being outside going for walks and riding his bike. Eugene enjoys camping and fishing and wants to go on outings with his future forever family. He especially enjoys going on outings with those closest to him. Eugene also likes swimming and shooting basketball outside. Another joy for Eugene is music, and he particularly enjoys listening to country and rap. Eugene likes being on the computer and loves playing with his tablet, especially the video games that he downloads. This quiet, affectionate and soft-spoken young man loves watching TV and movies with the adults in his life. Eugene likes playing with animals and gets along well with the dog at his current placement. When he gets older, Eugene wants to become a teacher, police officer or fire fighter.<br/><br/>Over the past year, Eugene has experienced a great deal of trauma and loss, and he struggles to open up about his feelings. He also struggles with his behavior but receives services to help him develop better coping skills. Eugene needs a great deal of time to build trust with other people before he feels truly comfortable with them, and it is anticipated that this will help him to fully open up and accept an adoptive family in the future. Eugene does best with structure and one-on-one attention.<br/><br/>Eugene would do best with two parents, but a single-female parent with a strong support system would be considered. He will need one-on-one attention and constant supervision. Eugene would do best as the youngest or only child in the home. The family must make sure Eugene receives the support services to help him reach his full potential now and into adulthood. Eugene would benefit from a family who involves him in structured and supervised activities with peers. His family also must be patient as Eugene develops trust and transitions into his new home.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C08064";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:16;s:4:"Race";s:5:"White";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C08064.20170504.143857.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/WOPEcF5N2RY";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C08064.20170504.143857.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
