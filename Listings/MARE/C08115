He is an excited kid who knows what he likes. Eddie says that he likes math, reading and gym class. He enjoys sports and would like to play basketball and football. In fact, Eddie already has had a shot at hoops heaven. He’s visited the Detroit Pistons’ locker room, and he’s touched and posed with the jersey of their star player, Andre Drummond. He even sat in the Piston center’s locker-room chair. He’s also dribbled on the Pistons’ practice court, but he isn’t done there. When Metro Airport clears the Pistons’ jet for takeoff, Eddie wants the star treatment aboard the team plane. And if the Pistons don’t draft and sign him, he’ll settle for another flight. “I would like to be on the Pistons,” says Eddie, “but if not, I would be OK with any other team as long as I’m in the NBA.” His worker calls Eddie “a sports fanatic. “He loves attending basketball games with his mentor and enjoys playing a game of one-on-one. In addition to playing basketball, Eddie likes watching TV and playing Nintendo DS. Eddie also can be helpful and likes to volunteer, and he reports that he’s a nice person who is trying to do better.<br/><br/>Eddie can be reserved at first, and it takes him a while to show others his true personality. Eddie has been working hard and doing well to make positive choices, to express himself through positive outlets and to manage his emotions appropriately. Eddie made such big strides recently that his worker says, “This is the furthest he’s come to addressing his past” and showing that he wants to make improvements. Eddie is doing well at school and has done his best to adjust and make progress. <br/><br/>Eddie needs an adoptive family who can provide him with understanding and acceptance. The family should have the skills to help Eddie express himself through positive means, stay calm and help him when he feels frustrated. Eddie is open to a two-parent or single-parent home. However, he would benefit from a positive and strong male role model, whether through a father figure or another male within the family support system. The adoptive family must be active advocates to ensure that all of his needs are met in the home, at school and in the community. The family must provide Eddie with structure and a calm approach as he has shown the ability to thrive in that type of home environment. Eddie would like to be the youngest or only child in the home. Eddie should be able to continue contact with his sister and his current foster parents as they have a strong relationship.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C08115";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:15;s:4:"Race";s:5:"Black";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C08115.20160509.135511.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-09-2016";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/aGqZvNTvoys";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C08115.20160509.135511.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
