He wants trees protected … and animals, too. “I want to help around the world, help people and animals,” he says. Brendan has quite the scientific mind. If he could visit anywhere in the world, he’d want to travel to the Arctic Circle because it has – according to Brendan – “low air pressure and different matter.” No wonder he lists science as his favorite subject in school, which helps explain why this busy as a bee young man wants to become a scientist when he gets older. Or an entrepreneur. Brendan says he dreams of making and selling cars or making shoes. If those career paths don’t pan out, Brendan has his sights set on becoming an artist and making a living drawing comics, which seems appropriate. After all, his favorite toy is Lego Marvel Superheroes. Brendan also enjoys playing sports such as football and basketball. On the weekends, he enjoys going outside, playing videos and watching TV. His favorite thing to do after school is “jam to music.” His other favorite things include Chinese for food, ruby blue and orange for color and snakes for animal. When he’s asked what he wants to do with a future forever family, Brendan says he wants to go places such as LEGOLAND and history museums.<br/><br/>Due to his past trauma, Brendan has to work hard to manage his emotions and behavior. “He has done well with identifying some of his triggers,” one of Brendan’s workers says, “but he also understands that he has a long way to go.” Even though he struggles with his past, he’s made a “great deal of progress.” In school, Brendan would benefit from assistance to help him stay on task. <br/><br/>Brendan would do best with a two-parent family who can provide love, support, structure and continuous supervision. Brendan should be the youngest or only child in the home. His parents should be patient, understanding and experienced to help Brendan identify and utilize his coping skills when he’s having difficulty. His parents would benefit from having knowledge of the impact of trauma on a child’s behavior and development. His family must be strong advocates for the services Brendan requires to thrive in school, at home and in the community. They also must be patient as Brendan transitions into his new home. Finally, an adoptive family should be open to letting Brendan maintain sibling contact as deemed appropriate in the future.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C08166";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:14;s:4:"Race";s:5:"White";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C08166.20170504.123832.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/urlRlWf3cAc";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C08166.20170504.123832.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
