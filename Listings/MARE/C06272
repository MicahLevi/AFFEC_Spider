He especially enjoys reading Harry Potter books. David is very active and describes himself as artistic, creative and athletic. He really wants to participate in organized football. David also enjoys playing video games, and he loves playing the Minecraft and Pokemon game series. When he gets older, David wants to become a video game designer, which might help him realize his three wishes. If he had three wishes. David dreams possessing a million dollars, owning a mansion and reserving another three wishes for anything else that might arise. David is a friendly child with a great imagination and a natural curiosity about how things work. He can sometimes appear shy and reserved, but he opens up with others once he feels comfortable. He can also be outgoing when he feels comfortable in his environment. Another joy for David is cats. He remembers having one climb up on his shoulder and rub its face against his. “It was really cute,” he says.<br/><br/>David is working hard to manage his emotions regarding his past. He can be slow to trust others and benefits from patience in building new relationships. David is learning to develop positive coping skills and identify and express his feelings through appropriate outlets. He does well academically at school but may become frustrated in the classroom when he does not understand the instructions or if he feels misunderstood. David does have a sensitivity to touch that will need to be monitored.<br/><br/>David needs a patient and loving family who can make a firm commitment and provide clear boundaries and consistent supervision. He would thrive in a one- or two-parent home as long as there is structure and a routine. David would do best as the only, youngest or oldest child in the family; “otherwise,” says his worker, he may feel ‘lost’ somewhere in the middle.” His parents need to be patient and be willing to advocate for the support services that David needs now and in the future. In addition, David would benefit from a transitional period into his new home. Finally, David wants his future forever family to know that he would like to maintain a relationship with his brother.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C06272";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:16;s:4:"Race";s:5:"White";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C06272.20170504.142443.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ddR0ou8QZnk";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C06272.20170504.142443.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
