His worker describes Big Buddy as a very pleasant boy with an “inviting personality.” She adds that Darnell “is a very lovable child.” When it’s time to play, Big Buddy makes big plans. He likes playing outdoors and especially enjoys shooting hoops. Darnell also enjoys putting puzzles together and playing video games on his PlayStation 2, and he likes to play with his toy cars and trucks. Darnell has a creative side to his personality as well. He likes drawing. “I am very proud of my cartoons I draw!” he says. Darnell adds that he’s a funny and active teen who enjoys attending church with his foster family. When he’s ready to chill, Darnell might settle into a comfortable chair with a good book or he might tune the TV to some cartoons. This Big Buddy has big plans for his future, too. He wants to become a police officer, which seems to be a natural fit. After all, serving and protecting come naturally to any Big Buddy.<br/><br/>“Darnell is a little wary of his adoption plan and will need a transitional period to adjust to a new adoptive home,” says his worker. Darnell will require patience as he continues to make progress on his feelings and behavior through the services he receives. Generally, Darnell does well in school academically and behaviorally.<br/><br/>A forever family for Darnell must be willing to adopt his siblings Kaylen and Mikayla. The children would do best with a mom and dad who have parenting experience. They’ve all stated a preference for a family who has other children. They’ve also said that they want a family who shares their interest in a variety of activities including attending church. Finally, their family must advocate for any services that will help Kaylen, Mikayla and Darnell thrive at home and in school.
