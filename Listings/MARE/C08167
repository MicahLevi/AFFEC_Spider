His first wish is to “fight for the U.S. military.” When he gets back from duty, Jason will use the second wish for “a gold Corvette with diamonds on it.” That Vette likely will be stylin’ with a black and purple interior since those are Jason’s favorite colors. When Jason tires of his new ride, he might travel to Paris. He says he wants to go sightseeing there some day. For now, Jason settles for doing some of his favorite activities such as reading, coloring and drawing. True to his military interest, Jason enjoys playing “Call of Duty” on the Xbox. Jason likes everything about the military including its history, weapons and war. He takes pride in his family’s military history. Jason also is proud of his family’s Native American heritage. In fact, he’s quite knowledgeable about Native American culture. In addition to his heritage, Jason has a third thing that gives him pride, winning a medal after running in a 5K race. With a background like that, who needs a third wish?<br/><br/>Jason has some significant needs and behaviors that require careful monitoring. His worker says Jason is “able to create relationships and bonds with people.” In school, Jason needs assistance to benefit his success, but he is very motivated to perform well and says art is his favorite subject.<br/><br/>Jason is open to any type of parental combination, and his worker says “any type of family could be good” for him. However, Jason has stated a preference for being the only child in the home. His family will need to be strong advocates for the services that will help Jason function at his best now and into adulthood. His family also should encourage and be supportive of Jason learning about his heritage. Finally, Jason has stated a preference for a family who has a dog, especially a husky.
