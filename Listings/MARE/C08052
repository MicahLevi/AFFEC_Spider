He enjoys talking about basketball and showing off his skills. Trevon also likes playing video games, watching TV and movies. Trevon enjoys drawing pictures and mostly draws illustrations of cars. If he could visit anywhere, Trevon would travel to Africa, perhaps to see his favorite animal, the monkey. Trevon’s other favorite things include red for color, macaroni for food and “Dragon Ball Z” for game. When he gets older, Trevon wants to become a boxer and auto mechanic. If he had three wishes, Trevon would want to be rich, own a home and “have a great family,” he says. When he’s asked about what makes him most proud, Trevon says, “Myself because I dance and sing.” This sweet, kind and loving boy likes getting hugs and longs for consistency with the people in his life. He thinks family is very important and cares greatly for his brother. With his future forever family, Trevon looks forward to playing together and possibly shooting some hoops.<br/><br/>Trevon has struggled with managing his emotions, behaviors and demonstrating good boundaries at times, but he is working to develop new coping skills and learning how to be respectful of the personal space and boundaries of others. Trevon responds best to a highly structured and consistent setting both in the home and at school.  He will benefit from a parenting style that is positive in nature and gives gentle reminders and praise for tasks completed. <br/><br/>Trevon would do best with a mom and a dad.  Trevon requires a great deal of attention and supervision so it is best if he is the only or youngest child in the home.  A future forever family would need to be experienced in handling a child who has a good deal of needs. Trevon’s new family must make sure that he receives the services that will help him thrive at home and in school. His new family would need to provide a structured environment for Trevon. Trevon will also need extra time to transition into a new home, which may include multiple visits. Trevon also would like an adoptive family who would allow him to maintain contact with his brother.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C08052";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:14;s:4:"Race";s:5:"Black";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C08052.20160713.115131.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"07-13-2016";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/5S3HXkvtTtk";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C08052.20160713.115131.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
