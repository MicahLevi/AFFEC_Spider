Described as intelligent and articulate, Nolan puts science at the top of his favorite subjects in school because he likes “dinosaurs and fossils and stuff like that.” In fact, if he could go anywhere on Earth he reports, “I would like to go back in time to see the dinosaurs because I like dinosaurs.” On his favorite activities list, Nolan includes riding bikes and playing soccer and basketball with his friends. When he’s not active and scientific, Nolan might be seen munching on his favorite food – pizza – or cheering on his favorite hockey team, the Detroit Red Wings. One of Nolan's workers says, "Nolan’s smile and laugh is contagious." He goes on to say, "Nolan has a caring, funny and loving personality that is undeniable." Now all he needs is an equally awesome family.  When asked about his hopes for a family, Nolan shares, “I’m going places. Y’all got to adopt me because I just need a family for once.”<br/><br/>Nolan is working very hard on venting his frustrations through positive outlets. He is learning how to appropriately express his emotions and improve his decision-making skills. Nolan does best when he can receive plenty of individualized attention, direction and redirection. He is learning how to establish and develop positive peer interactions at school and in the community. Nolan is very intelligent but benefits from consistent reminders to stay on point.  His worker says, "Nolan has grown a lot lately. He is participating more in school and is doing well at asking for help when he needs it."<br/><br/>The ideal family for Nolan would have knowledge of or experience in parenting children who have been diagnosed with developmental needs and who have experienced trauma. The family must have a lot of patience and time to commit to Nolan since he thrives on individual attention. The family should be very structured and provide Nolan with a consistent and steady daily routine. Nolan will need a family who will understand and be accepting of Nolan’s past and help him achieve his fullest potential. Nolan needs a strong adoptive family to advocate for him in the community and at school. Nolan would do best as the youngest or only child in the home. It is important to Nolan that is able to remain in contact with his siblings and various relatives as these are significant bonds to him.
