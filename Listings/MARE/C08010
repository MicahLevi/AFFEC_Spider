His natural talent shows when he’s drawing or playing guitar. His favorite activities include swimming, bike riding and playing baseball. He also enjoys playing video games, which is his favorite after-school activity. Donny’s list of favorites includes pizza for food and blue for color. When he gets older, Donny wants to become an engineer, but his first goals are to graduate from high school and college. Donny also dreams of traveling to Disneyland and having enough wealth to pay for it.<br/><br/>His foster parent say that Donny’s behavior can be challenging, but he has made improvements since his placement in the home. Donny can use help in expressing himself appropriately and building self-esteem. In school, he struggles with behavior as well as academics, but it’s believed that Donny could do better if he can stay focused. <br/><br/>Donny would do best in a two-parent family in which he is the only or youngest child. His parents should be patient and experienced. They will need to be strong advocates for the support services that will help Donny function at his best. The family must set clear expectations and be consistent with Donny. They also must be able to supervise Donny when he is around younger children. Finally, since Donny has a close bond with his siblings, his family must be willing to let him maintain those relationships.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C08010";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:15;s:4:"Race";s:11:"MultiRacial";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C08010.20170504.103903.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/wqzozvd_Ggs";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C08010.20170504.103903.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
