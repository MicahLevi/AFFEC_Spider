He also enjoys singing, dancing and writing music. “He is currently writing a song about his time in foster care,” says his worker. When he’s not writing music, he’s listening to it on one of his favorite devices, an MP3 player. “Adrian is a good artist and singer,” the worker says. “He is able to remember lyrics to songs, old and new.” His other favorite things include baby blue for color, Siberian husky for animal and pizza, burgers, deviled eggs and veggies for food. In school, Adrian likes math and science, and after school, he participates in a program in which youngsters play games, watch movies, decorate t-shirts and cook or bake. One of the most important things he wants others to know about him is, “I’m a lover not a fighter.” One of his workers takes it a step further: “Adrian is kind and compassionate and cares about what others think about him … He enjoys socializing with adults.” "Adrian is a typical teen who had a blast hamming it up for the camera at our recent visit," shared another worker.  With his forever family, Adrian would like to get to know them and bond with them by having fun and perhaps playing board games or doing activities in the community.<br/><br/>“Adrian is a warm, caring and sweet individual,” his worker says. Adrian is working at maintaining friendships but can have difficulties in this area at times; however, he wants people to know that he’s working on his social skills. His worker says Adrian “has a strong desire” to bond with a family. She adds that Adrian is generally happy but can get down and be fearful of expressing his feelings. Sometimes, Adrian needs redirection, and he is learning to respect others’ personal space and boundaries.<br/><br/>Adrian wants a family to be patient as he develops trust and bonds with them. He would do best in a two-parent family, but a single-female parent would be considered. His parents should be experienced and able to provide the one-on-one attention and assistance that would help Adrian thrive at home, at school and in the community. In addition, Adrian should be the only child in the home. One of Adrian’s workers suggests that Adrian’s parents should be “able to be firm but with a gentle hand.” Adrian also has an older brother and it would be best for him to maintain contact with his brother.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C06170";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:18;s:4:"Race";s:5:"Black";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C06170.20170425.152506.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"04-25-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hc0WDs6q5us";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C06170.20170425.152506.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
