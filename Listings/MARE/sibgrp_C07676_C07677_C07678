Her harmonious side shows when Kaylen sits down at the piano. She’s self-taught and knows how to read music. Kaylen even enjoys playing the drums. Kaylen also shows talent in her scholarly pursuits. She earns good grades, has received awards and has been on the honor roll at school. “Kaylen reported that she enjoys attending the school,” says her worker. ”Kaylen stated that she would like to attend college after completing high school.” This quiet and gifted girl describes herself as a nice person who cares about others.

When she’s asked to describe herself, Mikayla says she’s nice and protective of others whom she cares about.<br/><br/>Mikayla has some struggle that she’s working on with the help of the services she receives.

When he’s ready to chill, Darnell might settle into a comfortable chair with a good book or he might tune the TV to some cartoons. This Big Buddy has big plans for his future, too. He wants to become a police officer, which seems to be a natural fit. After all, serving and protecting come naturally to any Big Buddy.<br/><br/>“Darnell is a little wary of his adoption plan and will need a transitional period to adjust to a new adoptive home,” says his worker.
