This mechanically inclined, tech savvy teen loves taking things apart and putting them back together and has shown a natural ability to figure out any type of electronic device. In fact, his worker describes Jacob as “creative and imaginative in his ability to make things and build things.” “Mr. Gadget” turns into “Mr. Fix-It” when repairing things that are broken, which is another natural ability. Not surprisingly, Jacob’s favorite subject in school is science, and he says he enjoys science experiments. This “Mr. Science” enjoys a good laugh, too. “Jacob has a good sense of humor,” says his worker, who adds that Jacob uses sarcasm to joke around and laugh with others.  Another worker describes Jacob as a kid who “cares about others and immediately wants to share whatever he has with others.” Jacob also likes to cook, and his favorite dish is chicken alfredo with carrot cake for dessert. <br/><br/>When he’s comfortable with people, Jacob can be engaging and courteous, yet he struggles with his emotions and has difficulty with peer relationships. Due to his past disappointments, Jacob would benefit from guidance in learning how to express his feelings and how to develop and maintain peer relationships. In the classroom, Jacob can do well and does best with one-on-one attention. Jacob is learning how to follow the rules and to weigh the consequences for his actions before acting. <br/><br/>Due to his past trauma, Jacob requires the kind of one-on-one attention and direct supervision that a family with two experienced parents can give. His new parents would benefit from knowledge of the impact of trauma on a child’s behavior and development. Jacob would do best as the only child but at least needs to be the youngest one in the home. Jacob would benefit from a patient adoptive family who will support him and advocate for any services that would address his needs. A family with pets would be ideal, says Jacob, who would be at home in a rural setting since he likes motorcycles, fishing and being outdoors. “Jacob would like a family who is creative and likes to fish,” adds his worker.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C06202";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:17;s:4:"Race";s:5:"White";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C06202.20170504.145128.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-UsThWEY10U";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C06202.20170504.145128.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
