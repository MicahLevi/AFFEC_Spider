He likes playing it at school and after school. “He feels his strengths are playing basketball,” says his worker. He also likes playing video games, especially on the Xbox 360. Ni’Shawn is an outgoing, social young man who loves to joke around. He has a sarcastic sense of humor that really shows in his ability to connect and interact with people. Since he loves basketball, Ni’Shawn hopes his future forever family will attend games together. “He would benefit from involvement in the community through a sports team or other supportive activity,” says his worker. Ni’Shawn also wants to go the movies with his future family.<br/><br/>“Ni’Shawn is very helpful and tries to please the adults in his life,” says one of his workers, who adds that Ni’Shawn has good and bad days behaviorally. Ni’Shawn will need assistance in establishing a consistent daily routine. Ni’Shawn is working on building positive coping skills, effectively managing his feelings and improving his academics. He is showing improvements at maintaining himself in the classroom and reaching his potential in his studies. <br/><br/>Ni’Shawn would do best with a two-parent family or a single parent with a good support system. Ni’Shawn also should be the youngest child in the home, but families with younger school-aged children may be considered. His family must be strong advocates for the services that Ni’Shawn needs to function at his best. The family will need to be very patient and supportive of Ni’Shawn as he learns to manage his emotions and build new and trusting relationships. Since his loves athletics, a family should be willing to encourage Ni’Shawn’s participation in sports. Lastly, Ni’Shawn really wants to be adopted with his brother Antonio (C07908), but if that’s not possible, his family must be willing to let him maintain contact with Antonio as well as his sister, Shantaina (C07907).";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C07906";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:15;s:4:"Race";s:5:"Black";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C07906.20170504.130655.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"05-04-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:1;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:40:"http://www.youtube.com/embed/a6yBUrqJ5o8";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C07906.20170504.130655.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
