Kevin also enjoys cooking and quilting. Another one of Kevin’s favorite activities is watching musicals. His favorites are “Hairspray” and “High School Musical.” One of Kevin’s other favorite activities is looking at old photos and picture books. He also enjoys singing, dancing and putting puzzles together. All in all, Kevin is an upbeat and happy young man with a great sense of humor.<br/><br/>Kevin has good days and bad in which he sometimes has difficulty communicating his feelings and expresses frustration verbally or physically. However, most of the time, Kevin does not have difficult behavior. He has bonded with his foster father but even more with his foster mother.<br/><br/>Ideally, an adoptive family for Kevin would be experienced in working with children who require constant care. A two-parent home would be ideal for Kevin because he benefits from one-on-one attention and assistance. Kevin also would do well in a placement with other children, but he is not comfortable around infants and toddlers. His adoptive parents will need to be patient and willing to learn new ways to help Kevin reach his potential. Since Kevin enjoys animals, a home with pets could prove to be a therapeutic benefit to him.";s:11:"ListingCode";s:6:"C08120";s:6:"Gender";s:4:"Male";s:3:"Age";i:16;s:4:"Race";s:11:"MultiRacial";s:10:"SiblingIds";s:0:"";s:12:"SiblingNames";s:0:"";s:13:"PhotoLocation";s:49:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/C08120.20170623.094426.jpg";s:12:"PhotoUpdated";s:10:"06-23-2017";s:11:"NoImagePath";s:49:"/DesktopModules/MARE.Directory/images/noimage.jpg";s:8:"HasVideo";b:0;s:13:"VideoLocation";s:0:"";s:13:"ThumbnailPath";s:60:"/Portals/0/ChildImages/Thumbnails/C08120.20170623.094426.jpg";s:5:"Title";s:0:"";s:9:"IsVisible";b:1;s:6:"IsMale";b:1;s:8:"IsFemale";b:0;s:6:"IsOpen";b:1;s:18:"IsReviewingMatches";b:0;s:18:"IsPendingPlacement";b:0;s:11:"HasSiblings";b:0;s:16:"ListableSiblings";a:0:{}}
