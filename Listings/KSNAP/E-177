He enjoys playing video games and reading. In the past he has enjoyed a good ‘magic trick’, although now he is currently interested in ‘everything that involves the DC comic/Batman’.  Although he can enjoy short trips and vacations, he generally prefers the routine of ‘being at home’ and ‘hanging out’ rather than elaborate vacations.  Jayson typically does okay in school, although he does have some challenges in the educational environment. His favorite part of school, is participating in band, where he plays percussion instruments. He is looking for a family that would be supportive of his interest in ‘drumming’ on everyday items around him.   He is capable of doing very well academically, with a positive and supportive family to encourage him.  He does not like the ‘dreaded vegetables’ and may run from an actual ‘salad’.   He  prefers pasta based foods like spaghetti.  Jayson has been challenged by numerous losses in his life, particularly the loss of his siblings.  He will need a supportive and understanding family to help him continue to process the grief and loss in his life, and to help him move forward to adulthood.   He would do better in a home where he is the youngest child in a family.  If your family would be a good place for Jayson to learn and grow, please contact the KY Special Needs Adoption Program?								</td>
