Upon meeting her, one might tend to agree.  Charlie likes to joke and is very social.  Miley Cyrus is her favorite musician and she loves to listen to music on her MP3 player.  Charlie loves to sing and dance.  Volleyball is her favorite sport and she says that she is always ready to try new things.  Pizza or pizza rolls, spaghetti and meatballs, and peanut butter and banana sandwiches are her favorite foods.  Like most children cauliflower and mushrooms are NOT her favorites!  Someday Charlie would like to visit Holiday World and Disney World.  Puppies and kittens bring a beautiful smile to little Charlie’s face. Church is something Charlie enjoys, especially if she can sing!  Her greatest hope is that a family will love her and help her learn to not feel angry.  Charlie’s final words to her future adoptive family are that she hopes that they will love her and talk her through any problems she might have in life.  Charlie will do best in a family who has lots of energy, patience, and unconditional love!  Charlie will bring a smile and excitement to a family.  If that family is yours, please don’t hesitate!										</td>
