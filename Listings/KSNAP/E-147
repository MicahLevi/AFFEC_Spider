Ashalique loves fashion and styling her hair. She also enjoys styling other’s hair as well! Ashalique enjoys taking trips to the mall with her friends and would like to do this activity with a family as well. Ashalique is open to all types of families and she does not have a preference when it comes to the makeup of the family. She prefers to be placed with younger children, but having older children in the home is not a big deal. Ashalique is allergic to cats so she will not be able to live in a home with our feline friends. Ashalique needs a family that will be loving and supportive as she grows and matures into a young lady. Are you interested in helping this young lady find her place in life?
