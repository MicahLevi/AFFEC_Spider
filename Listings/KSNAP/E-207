He seems afraid, but you soon realize that he is a brave person to have endured his past and continue to work hard at his future. Damion is an excellent student and has made the honor roll at school.  He also has perfect attendance at school and is up and ready for school when told.
Damion is a hard worker who needs to have structure in his routine because he does not adapt to changes very well.  He does like to be helpful to others and strives to do a good job without being told twice.
Damion has a tendency to give into peer pressure and would do better in a home without other children.  He has stated that he would like to have both a mother and a father in his forever family.  He would like to live in the city but still enjoys the outdoor sports and hiking.  Damion would like to travel and visit Florida someday but has no desire to go to Mexico. Damion has come a long way in controlling the anger inside of him and continues to improve daily.
The parents of Damion must not expect to bond quickly and must provide structure, which will clearly communicate to him that he has limits in his behaviors and activities.  There is much potential in this young man â€“he needs help finding it, are you the family that can help him reach his potential?  If so please contact the SNAP office Damion is waiting for you.
