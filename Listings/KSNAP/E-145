Alexa enjoys running and has participated in a running club and has completed marathons. Alexa says “I am very active, enjoy sports like basketball, cheerleading, softball, running and swimming, arts and crafts making t-shirts, bracelets and making stones with hand prints or mosaic stones.

When asked to describe what she would like her parent to be, “I want a mother who would understand me, want to spend time with me, just hang out, would be able to do things for me, family stuff like going out to eat, going shopping, swimming, to have a game night, a movie night and for the family to eat dinner together. I want to be active and be able to get involved in lots of activities, and not become a couch potato. I am a Christian and enjoy going to church. I hope my forever family will to be Christian as well. I love animals and would like to have a pet one day. I would love to live in a city like Louisville.”
