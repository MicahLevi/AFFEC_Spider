He might like to be a Boy Scout.  In fact, there are lots of things he might like to do once he joins an adoptive family. Zach is a boy who likes to be outdoors.  He is fascinated by bugs and enjoys learning about them. It would be great if Zach could be matched with an active family because he likes to stay busy and also needs close supervision.  Zach is very impulsive and always has his own idea of how he wants to do something (or not).  He craves one-on-one attention for nurturing and support.  Zach is affectionate and likes to be rewarded for his accomplishments.  He is bright but is easily distracted in school with everything going on around him.  He needs a little extra help with reading and math.  He will need an adoptive parent who can advocate for him at school and keep him advancing on track.  Zach also has artistic talent and likes to draw.  If you are an adoptive family who can roll with unexpected changes and challenges, Zach may be a great fit for your home.  He may enjoy being the only child and may not do well in a home with pets.  For more information about adopting Zach and the support services that are available, contact SNAP.
