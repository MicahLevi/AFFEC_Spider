He is funny and bright. He loves music, singing, and rapping. He is athletic and enjoys playing basketball, football, kickball, and dodge-ball. He would like the opportunity to participate on an organized sports team. Shy’Ron’s favorite foods are anything home cooked. Shy’Ron is friendly and outgoing and typically has a good day. Shy’Ron can be sensitive though if he feels he is being treated unfairly or is not being heard. Shy’Ron would be successful in an adoptive home that has a strong male presence either by parent or within the family’s support network, who could be a mentor. He needs an adoptive parent who has the awareness that healing doesn’t always come quickly. Shy’Ron will be very excited, and very anxious, about being adopted. Are you the family with the time and attention to give to Shy’Ron? This adorable young boy will surely shine with the love and support of a forever family.
