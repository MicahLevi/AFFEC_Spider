Brandon is an outgoing boy with a variety of interests! He is spontaneous and fun to be around. Baseball is his favorite sport. He likes to play with toys and build things. He also enjoys learning how to cook and bake. Brandon is a good student who usually receives Aâ€™s on all of his homework. The only time Brandon gets a lower grade is when he rushes through it. Brandon often likes to have attention focused on him, but he usually gets along with others, especially when doing something he enjoys.  He has leadership qualities and likes to be in charge. He participates in the Pride Patrol at school to help make sure his school is clean and neat.  He enjoys music and plays the trumpet in his school band. He has also expressed interest in learning to play guitar! Brandon would benefit from having a strong, positive male role model. He needs a family who will provide excellent supervision and structure. Please contact SNAP today for more information! </td>
