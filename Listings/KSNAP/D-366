She enjoys music, arts and crafts, coloring, and reading. McKayla is very loving and affectionate. She is also very busy and curious about the world around her.  She can be attention seeking and loves to have your undivided attention. She needs an adoptive parent with patience, perseverance, and time to devote to her. An adoptive parent will need to be very consistent with McKayla, set appropriate expectations and limits for her behavior, and prompt her to keep her on track. She needs a parent who will advocate for her educational needs and support teachers in setting appropriate expectations for learning and discipline in the classroom. McKayla continues to make progress with having a structured routine in her life and having plenty of encouragement and attention.  She could make even more progress with the love and stability of a forever family. McKayla does not fully understand what being adopted means, but adoption is something that would make a world of difference for McKayla now and in her future.  To learn more about adoption and the support services that are available, contact SNAP. Please view Kayla's interview at:
