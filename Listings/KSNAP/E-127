(11/99) Josh is very creative and does a great job capturing moments by finding beauty in everyday life through his photography. He currently plans to go to college and would like to study photography and/or social work as he would like to help people. Josh enjoys antiquing and going to church. He has a sweet and polite personality and responds well to affirmation and encouragement. Josh is in need of a family who will take the time to listen to him and show him that he matters.
