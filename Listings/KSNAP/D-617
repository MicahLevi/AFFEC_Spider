He makes friends easily and is well known in his small community.  Jerry loves to ride his bike and play outdoors with his neighbors and his animal friends.  He has a cat, rabbits and chickens in his current home.  His new favorite thing is adding items to the spokes of his bike to make ‘cool sounds’ as he rides.    Even though he is getting older, Jerry continues to be interested in community helpers such as firemen and police officers.  He LOVES talking to these community helpers, and wants to be a helper like them when he grows up.  The majority of the fire department participated in his birthday party last summer at the neighborhood pool.  At a recent annual court update, Jerry charmed the entire room with his excitement about sitting in a police car, playing with a pair of handcuffs and touring their holding cells.  Jerry continues to perform behind same age peers in the school environment, and will continue to need a lot of educational supports in the classroom.  He needs a forever family that can help him achieve small successes academically, and that will provide close supervision and clear boundaries in the community and world.  Jerry’s ideal family would live in Kentucky (or a surrounding state) where he can maintain contact with his current life and family connections.  Are you the right family to help Jerry learn and grow?  Contact the KY Special Needs Adoption Program to find out if Jerry would be a good fit for your family.  He is waiting for a family to call his ‘forever’, and to never have to move again!</td>
