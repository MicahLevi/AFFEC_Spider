He is a friendly, polite child, who has a very sad soul. This is a remarkable boy in that he has endured much in his young life.  It would be easy for any family to fall in love with him once they get to know him. Travis has a tough time letting go of his past and will ask many questions.  

Travis’ favorite singer in the whole wide world is Michael Jackson, and he can perform any of the singer’s dance moves for you.  In his free time, Travis enjoys playing games on his PSP, going to pawn shops, and shopping on E-bay. He has an avid interest in the military and in Zombies, so one year for Halloween he dressed as a Union soldier Zombie.  He likes to watch Zombie shows and movies. 

The best family for Travis is one that will be patient and understanding, and will allow for him to stay in contact with siblings. This young man is looking for a permanent family and would make an awesome addition to the right family. Are you that family for Travis?
