He has a very high energy level and moves quickly from one task to another. He loves going to the park and running and swinging.  These physical outlets help him to focus and calm himself.   He enjoys small, frequent snacks such as pretzels and dry cereal mixes.  Adison finds small spaces to be comforting, and he is attracted to lights and spinning objects.  He finds back rubs to be calming and enjoys it when others mimic his sounds and actions.  Adison needs a forever family that has a lot of patience and the ability to help with hygiene.  He needs a family that is willing to work with the school system to meet his educational needs.  Do you have a home that would welcome an active boy with a lot of energy?  The Special Needs Adoption Program has services available to assist with adopting a child such as Adison. 										</td>
