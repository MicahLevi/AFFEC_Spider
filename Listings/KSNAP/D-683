He loves to be the center of attention, and is usually ‘on the go’.  When Casey is not moving fast, he loves to cuddle up under a heavy ‘weighted’ blanket and watch tv and movies.  He still enjoys Mickey Mouse and some other Disney favorites.  At the playground, he loves the sensory movement he gets from swinging,  and he loves to bounce on moving bridges and enjoys a variety of different climbing structures.  Although Casey has challenges with verbal communication, he is able to communicate through some sign language.  He is clearly able to communicate that he wants food, and is able to communicate a wide variety of personal preferences.   One of his positive reinforcements is the option of choosing which flavored powder he adds to his water bottle.  He has some definite favorites!  He also loves a wide variety of games and apps on the I-Pad, and it can be a great motivator for him.    Casey has experienced a lot of instability in his life, and needs a stable, permanent and loving home.  He needs a loving and consistent family that will provide a high level of structure and support.  Are you the lucky parent that will be given the opportunity to love this child forever?
