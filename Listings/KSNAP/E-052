He is a fun-loving kid who enjoys sports (basketball and football in particular), and can run up a good score on video games.  Will has ambitions of going to college to study computer programming.  He would like to become a video game designer one day.  
When you meet Will, you will be impressed with his wit and good sense of humor.  He is helpful and polite and does a wonderful job of helping out with chores around the house.  Sometimes Will may use his humor to help him cope with stressful or new situations.  He will need an adoptive family who can provide patience, support, consistency, and guidance to allow Will to adjust to a new home.  Will understands that his goal is Adoption and he is open to meeting a prospective family. He would need time to get to know his adoptive parents and time to trust that they will care for him.  Will needs a place to grow up.  He needs the security of knowing that he has a “forever family”.  He will be entering high school next year and has big plans for his future.
If you think your family may be compatible and would like to learn more about Will, please contact SNAP today.
