In spite of a few hard knocks, Chrishan is on the road to a bright future.  Chrishan is an intelligent young man but has to work hard to catch up on some of the schooling he has missed due to twists and turns in his life.  Chrishan is resilient, strong, and athletic.  A stable and loving adoptive family would help him reach his potential and he could know this home would be his last stop.  Running away from your problems is not the right answer, and Chrishan is willing to face his with the love and support of a forever family.  Chrishan needs mentoring and a parent who will guide and nurture him and keep him on the right track to recovery and healing.  For more information, contact SNAP today.										</td>
