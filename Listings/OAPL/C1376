					<br /><br /><span class="profile_header">Child Profile</span><br /><p>Have you ever met a child with a name that is just perfect for them? That would be Hope. Hope is full of optimism, joy and yes hope. She wants very much to find her "forever family". Hope is loving, kind, and very talkative. She likes to listen to music, color and write in her journal. Hope asks her worker at every visit if her family has been found. She has even asked if there was anything she could do to help find them.</p><br /><br /><span class="profile_header">Desired Family</span><br /><p>Hope is searching for a family that is patient, nurturing, won’t give up on her when there is a challenge and will provide unconditional love. If you believe you can give “hope” to Hope please have your home study sent to <a href="mailto:glturner@fccs.us">glturner@fccs.us</a> or <a href="mailto:lmhall@fccs.us">lmhall@fccs.us</a> </p></p>
