He also enjoys riding his bike, playing with remote control toys and collecting Yugioh cards. Brian is drawn to anything related to Star Wars and is hoping to get a light saber for his birthday. Brian is a good student. His favorite subject is math and his favorite food is spicy Doritos. Brian hopes to become a heavy equipment operator someday.</p><br /><br /><span class="profile_header">Desired Family</span><br /><p>Brian is so excited at the thought of having a family to call his own. He has three younger siblings who are all in the process of being adopted. Brian needs a family who would support the siblings remaining in contact. Brian does best in environments where he feels safe. He desires to be an only child, as he craves the attention of his caregivers. Brian loves attending church and does well with animals. He has never been to an amusement park or gone on vacation. Could your family be the one to celebrate with Brian as he experiences many “firsts”?</p></p>
