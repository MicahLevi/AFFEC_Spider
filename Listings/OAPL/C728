He plays hard. He is also described as artistic. He loves new clothes and shoes. He is very polite. He enjoys listening to music and building with Legos and ride his bike.</p>
<p>Tavion is currently placed in a therapeutic foster home to address issues related to his significant history of abuse and neglect. He has great potential to succeed with the right family. Tavion likes being part of a family. He has a past history of completing a residential treatment program. He is in need of a family system that can help him feel worthy of a loving family. He would benefit from an empathetic and knowledgeable family that understands the impact that his abuse has had on his development and self-esteem and self-protection. Tavion has a sense of pride about the accomplishments he achieves at school. With the right family he would have the added motivation to continue to make achievements and strive to be successful. Right now he lacks hope of being able to find a forever family.</p><br /><br /><span class="profile_header">Desired Family</span><br /><p>The best family for Tavion is one that can look past his history to the person he is and the potential he has. He requires a parent(s) who can be firm and maintain structure in his life. He would do best in a home with older children, and preferably placed with females. Tavion need a family who can accept him for who he is and help him discover himself. The right family for Tavion will be willing to have involvement in his specialized treatment plan. Could you provide the hope of a family that Tavion needs?</p></p>
