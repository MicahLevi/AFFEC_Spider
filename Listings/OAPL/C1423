<p>Jaylawants to grow up and become a fashion designer one day, but she’ll settle for going to school and getting good grades for now. She says she’s most proud to get A’s and B’s. she’s not a huge sports fan, but she likes to hang out in the library or go shopping during her free time. When she’s home, you can either find Jaylaplaying video games or with her Lego pieces.</p>
<p>She likes to listen to a lot of different music, but R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Rap are among her favorites. Right now she loves to hear Nicki Minaj on the radio. Jayla also likes <em>Disney Channel</em> cartoons and <em>Disney</em> movies.</p>
<p>Some day she hopes to be taken to either Disney Land or Disney World—she’s not picky.</p>
<p>Bobby needs a family who can teach her to cope with her emotions and encourage her to continue being a bright and wonderful young woman!</p><br /><br /></p>
