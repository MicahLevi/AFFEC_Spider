She loves to be outside riding her bike, fishing, and swimming. She also very much enjoys watching television, listening to music and playing interactive video games on the Wii.</p>
<p>School can be a little bit of a struggle for her. However, she works hard to try and get good grades. One of the bigger struggles she has in school is making the right/ appropriate friends. Because Julie has a big heart and tries hard to fit in, she is easily taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Julie benefits from mental health services and support.</p>
<p>Julie is making great progress in her current foster home. She continues to work on boundaries and treating people with respect consistently.</p><br /><br /><span class="profile_header">Desired Family</span><br /><p>Julie would do best in a home that can provide consistency, supervision and give her an opportunity to be a teenager. She also very much needs a family to be patient and hold her accountable.</p>
<p>It would be great if Julie could find a two parent home with or without siblings. She really likes both country and city living.</p>
<p>Julie really desires to have an adoptive family. She wants someone to want her for her and be therefor love and support.</p></p>
