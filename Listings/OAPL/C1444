					<br /><br /><span class="profile_header">Child Profile</span><br /><p>Ana is a sweet and likable young girl. She is friendly, talkative, helpful, and seems to truly enjoy just about everything. She has an adventurous spirit and enjoys new experiences, foods ("I love to eat"), and friends. Ana loves clothes and shoes, and she favors anything pink, purple, animal print, sparkled, ruffled, or screen printed with characters and funny logos. Ana likes listening to music, watching TV and movies, talking on the phone, attending church and camp activities, going on family walks and riding her bike, drawing with sidewalk chalk, and being with her friends. <br /><br />Her not-so-favorite things are few and far between but they do exist. Being the social butterfly she is, she will avoid solitary activities if she can help it. Homework,reading, and chores fall into the "that's boring" category, but she is very proud of her accomplishments when she's finished a task.<br /><br /></p><br /><br /><span class="profile_header">Desired Family</span><br /><p>Ana's adoptive family will be strong advocates for her educational, medical, and behavioral needs. Day-to-day, Ana needs guidance and reminders when it comes to self-care, socialization, and respecting others boundaries.</p></p>
