She is an excellent student and was accepted into an International Baccalaureate Program when she enters high school next year. She has participated in track and volleyball and shows great promise as an athlete.</p>
<p>She has a tender heart when it comes to animals and adores her kitten and gerbil. She hopes that her chosen family will have a menagerie that her pets can become a part of. Ashley looks forward to a career working with animals.</p>
<p>Ashley's chosen family will need to understand that Ashley may be hesitant about adoption given past disappointments. She will need to continue with therapeutic services to address a past of trauma and loss. She deserves a family that will meet her where she is in life, encouraging her with unconditional commitment and understanding, and be ready to support her in all the amazing things she wants to do in life.</p>
