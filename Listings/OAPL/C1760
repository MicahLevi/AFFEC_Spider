He enjoys playing with other kids, being a leader, and the center of attention. EJ does well in a home with older children and animals. While EJ is very social, he can struggle with his interactions with other people. He responds well to praise with clear guidance and expectations. EJ also responds well to goal setting and rewards. He is very resourceful and will work hard to achieve his goals.</p><br /><br /><span class="profile_header">Desired Family</span><br /><p>EJ would do well in an experienced adoptive home where he can be the youngest child or only child. He loves one-on-one attention and does best when he receives it from his caregivers. EJ would also do well with an active family. He loves family activities such as board games, video games, fishing, camping, or just going out to dinner. He is developmentally on target and very bright, but will need some help getting caught up academically. He gets frustrated easily and responds well when he is talked through his frustrations.</p></p>
