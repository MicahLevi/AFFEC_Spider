Video games and movies can hold his attention, and when it comes to that stuff anything superhero is great. Jason likes sports. He has played on a basketball and football for his school. Jason has expressed interest in trying other sports, too. <br /><br />Some of Jason's favorite things include swimming, jumping on the trampoline, going to camp, eating at the Chinese buffet, and sweets! He does not turn down a dessert! He likes to sing along to the radio, with country and popular music stations being his favorites. He has a lovely singing voice.<br /><br />Jason needs a family that will appreciate all of the wonderful things about him. Jason has said that he would like to be "the only kid" in his forever family. Dogs help Jason feel safe at home, and he hopes his new family will have at least one dog.
