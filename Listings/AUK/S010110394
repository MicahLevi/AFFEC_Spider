Damari is all about activity and enjoys being read to, riding his bike, scooter, and just being outside.   </p><p>Damari is very smart and loves school, but sometimes he is distracted by his love for his friends and socializing.  </p><p>Damari has a medical condition that requires him to take a shot daily.  Don’t over think it...Parenting Damari is absolutely manageable; and lots of fun! An adoptive family will absolutely be able to learn what caring for Damari entails.  He is a tough little guy who enjoys rough housing with his friends and siblings.  </p><p>  </p><p>Meet Damani...</p><p>Damani is a joyful boy with a sweet personality. He is affectionate and likes to have fun playing with his toys, scooter, and bike.  Damani takes his time to warm up to people, but when he does he loves a good book to be read to him, and to cuddle.  </p><p>Damani is said to be a loner at school, but is very smart.  Damani sometimes gets upset when told “no,” but can be redirected.  I mean, who really likes to hear “no?” </p><p>Meet Samarion...</p><p>Samarion is a very active happy, energetic, and funny child. He enjoys making others laugh, I hear he is quite the jokester! You can usually find Samarion being social with his family and friends.  He interacts well with other children, and when he’s at home he’s playing with trains, Legos, drawing, and playing football.  </p><p>At school Samarion is the life of the classroom.  He enjoys horseplay and entertaining his peers, and teachers report he is very smart.  </p><p>Meet Damariea...</p><p>Damariea is a very mellow child, who is quiet, reserved, but very observant.  He is very active and loves many different sports like Basketball, and Football.  Damariea says football is his favorite sport.  In addition to sports, Damariea enjoys going away to camp in the summers and remote controlled cars.  </p><p>Damariea finds school to be challenging, because he struggles with reading and math.  He will sometimes act out in frustration, because he doesn’t understand the material.  He would benefit from some extra homework help.  </p><p>Meet Daniayah...</p><p>Daniayah is a very lively young lady who is a whiz on computers!

We are sure with a little work, time, patience, and the correct educational services; she’ll be a star pupil!  </p><p>The ideal family for this group would be resourceful in locating and utilizing services and will ensure needed services are in place.  The family will need to be able to communicate with schools, therapists, and medical providers and be able to navigate these systems.  The right family will provide a well-structured environment and consistency.  The right family will also involve these youth in appropriate extracurricular activities, and have energy for fun!</p><p></p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=63777'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
