        <div id='pNarr64714' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>Eri'uana, Errick, D'ivion, and Errion are a closely bonded sibling group who value family and the moments they create together. As the oldest, Eri'uana tends to take on a caregiver role to her brothers. She has had to learn to put this role on the backseat and embrace being a teenager. Errick is athletic and active. D'ivion is full of energy and likes to talk! Errion is also talkative and is working on trusting others. Errick and Errion are close and protect each other. They have a very loving relationship. Eri'uana, Errick, D'ivion, and Errion have normal sibling rivalries, but they are able to overcome their differences. The children enjoy spending time doing activities as a family. </p><p>Eri'uana, Errick, D'ivion, and Errion need a family with lots of patience. Their family will need to be able to provide structure and routine to help the children get acclimated to their new home. Preferably, the family will be experienced and willing to adopt all of the children together. Eri'uana, Errick, D'ivion, and Errion will need to continue to participate in supportive services individually and with their forever family. It is very important for them to stay in touch with their grandmother, so their forever family needs to be willing to maintain this family connection. </p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=64714'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
