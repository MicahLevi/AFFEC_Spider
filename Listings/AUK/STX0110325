        <div id='pNarr63330' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>Marla, Fabien, Andy, and Destiny are a tight knit group! Their love for each other is expressed with shouts of excitement and big hugs when they get together. Like most sibling groups, they have some typical sibling rivalries, but those rivalries push each child to be the best they can be for each other. Marla is sweet and talkative. She loves to socialize with new people. She tends to take on a "motherly" role to her younger siblings, but she is learning to be a child herself. Fabien can be quiet and shy. He is very soft-spoken when he talks and loves to be of help to others. Andy has a lot of energy and likes to stay moving. He has a very active imagination and likes to involve others in his play. Destiny is a very smart child, which contributes to her active imagination. She loves to give hugs and craves positive attention. It is very clear that the older siblings are the trailblazers for the younger ones. Marla and Fabien set the example for Andy and Destiny to follow, which makes them a close-knit group. Marla, Fabien, Andy, and Destiny enjoy going swimming, playing at the park, and going to the latest movie release. They love to go out to eat together and are not shy about letting their favorite foods be known!</p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=63330'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
