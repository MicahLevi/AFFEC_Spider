        <div id='pNarr64667' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>Meet Travis, Jordan, Collin, and Benjamin! These four incredible, exuberant boys would add joy and enthusiasm to any family. These boys are ALL boys!  They love the outdoors and want to be active as much as possible whether it is riding their bikes, playing sports, being in the woods, or playing with friends. They all enjoy playing in the pool or on the trampoline. Their forever family will certainly need to provide opportunities to remain active and explore their interests.  </p><p>   </p><p>Travis is described as funny and sensitive. He loves his four-wheeler, dirt bike, and playing with friends. He is depicted as a curious young boy who likes to explore. Jordan is funny, sweet, and quite introspective. He will ask many questions to satisfy his curiosity. Collin is a loving boy with a silly personality. Although more reserved than the others, he can connect easily with others allowing him to create strong bonds. Benjamin is a funny, wild country boy who loves spending his time in the woods, riding bikes, and engaging with friends. He enjoys demonstrating and receiving affection.  </p><p>All the boys long to become members of a forever family. The boys love one another and very much desire a forever family where they can be together. The ideal family for these young boys would need to be energetic and active. The right family for the boys will need to have patience and understanding during transition and support their connection to their grandparents. Travis, Jordan, Collin, and Benjamin would greatly benefit from loving parents who consistently promote a nurturing environment that is highlighted by guidance, encouragement, and reassurance. </p><p></p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=64667'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
