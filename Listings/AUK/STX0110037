        <div id='pNarr61565' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>Meet Jonathan, Gerard, Ricardo, Marcela, and Claudia! This sibling group is a fun, loving, and sweet bunch. Jonathan is the oldest of the group and is described as a big teddy bear. Jonathan is very sweet, loving, and emotional; he cares very deeply for his siblings. Gerardo likes to be called Gerry, and is the talkative one of the group. He is very smart, and likes to take care of others, especially his siblings. Ricardo, who likes to go by Mickey, is a bit quieter. Ricardo is very attentive and is also very close to his siblings. Marcela and Claudia are the biggest girly girls. Marcela enjoys playing with dolls and with children her age. Although Marcela may at times require some redirection, she does respond well to one on one attention. Claudia is the baby of the group, and is the move energetic of the group as well. Claudia may also need some redirection, she too responds well to redirection by adults.</p><p>Jonathan, Gerard, Ricardo, Marcela, and Claudia all wish to find a family where they feel secure, loved, and accepted. They will do well with a family who is consistent and structured, and who is able to display love and affection. The children long to be offered unconditional support, guidance, and supervision; with plenty of energy to be able to play and be active with them.  Attending a Christian church is important for all the children. Jonathan, Gerard, Ricardo, Marcela, and Claudia would like to live in Texas to be able to preserve their Hispanic culture.</p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=61565'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
