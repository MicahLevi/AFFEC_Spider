        <div id='pNarr64427' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>     Dhanayah is an intelligent and quiet young lady. Dhanayah is very creative and artistic. She loves to draw and enjoys making “storybooks” and scrapbooks. Dhanayah cares deeply for her siblings, but often becomes very emotional, as she feels like she is responsible for their well-being. Some of her current favorite activities include going to school, riding horses, and learning about Amazonian animals. If Dhanayah could do anything in the future, she would like to become a Marine Biologist or she would like to adopt all of the unwanted animals in the world. She enjoys being active outside with her siblings, swimming, riding bikes, or playing basketball and soccer. With support and encouragement, Dhanayah is beginning to learn how to accept responsibility and make appropriate behavior choices so that she can learn positive coping strategies for the future.</p><p>     Nevaeh is an intelligent and creative girl who is shy and often described as preoccupied with her thoughts. She likes having a “calm down” room because it is unobtrusive and a safe place to process her thoughts and feelings. Once she gets through her morning routine, her personality begins to shine through. One area in which her creativity is brought to the forefront is through weekly participation in a local Broadway Cabaret theater group for children. Although she enjoys visits with her siblings, she is searching for her niche as the middle child. </p><p>     Tariq is an active, inquisitive, and affectionate little boy. He is expressive and honest about his emotions, often revealing them with a high level of animation, and he has a huge and loving heart. Tariq loves doing puzzles and playing matching games; he completes them quite fast and with ease! He often has difficulty sharing, but can be easily redirected. He is making great strides in understanding and responding to the changes in his life. He is very attached to his oldest siblings and misses them terribly, especially his best buddy, Sahbay.</p><p>     Dez-Shanay is a happy and active little girl who loves attention. She is silly and a joy to be around. She is very independent and her speech and vocabulary are advanced for her age. She verbalizes her wants and needs, however, as with most toddlers, the word “no” causes a variety of reactions and challenges as she strives to discover and assert her independence. Dez-Shanay is at a great stage in life where she is easily impressed by her siblings – observing and mimicking their every move. </p><p>     Dhanayah, Nevaeh, Tariq, and Dez-Shanay share a close bond.  The desire is to place all four children together, however consideration will be given to finding two homes that would be wiling to keep the children in regular contact.  In order to maintain the ongoing relationship and to support the strong bond that exists with their two additional older siblings, any family considering the children must be committed to coordinating and accommodating regular visits with the siblings who live in southeast Pennsylvania. They are legally free for adoption.</p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=64427'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
