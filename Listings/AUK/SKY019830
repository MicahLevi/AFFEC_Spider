        <div id='pNarr60289' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>This is a very special sibling group with TWO sets of twins! The elder twins are Ali and Aliyah (12/05), followed by Miriam (05/07), then Haider (07/09), and lastly twins Jafar and Ahmad (01/11). Aliyah is more reserved and quiet but has a pleasant personality. She enjoys cheerleading, dancing and enjoys traditional girl things. Her twin Ali can be reserved too but becomes very talkative when a topic interests him. He loves to jump on a trampoline and is very adventurous and likes to try new things. Miriam is sweet, affectionate, and can be a bit shy at first, but is quite a little chatterbox once she gets to know you! She also enjoys cheerleading and dance. She likes school and gets good grades. Haider is a sweet and loveable boy. He gets along with his siblings and likes to play with stuffed animals and play video games. Ahmad is very energetic and likes to stay active. He loves to play outside. He takes a lot of pride in his appearance and enjoys looking good and playing with different hairstyles. His twin Jafar is more reserved and likes to be helpful. He is kind and generous and likes to do anything fun! Like his twin Ahmad, Jafar likes to make sure he looks good. Adopting a sibling group can be challenging, but these children deserve to stay together. If you believe you can open your home and your heart to this special sibling group, please contact SNAP today!    </p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=60289'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
