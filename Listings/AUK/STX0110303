        <div id='pNarr63209' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>Arial, Justin, Zian, and Jenna are fairly typical children. They share a close bond with each other and have a wonderful relationship. Arial is the oldest and works hard to set a good example for her younger siblings. Justin is the quiet one of the group, at least until he gets to know you! Zian is outgoing and very friendly. Jenna is very observant and pays attention to everything. She is also somewhat shy until she gets to know you.  Arial, Justin, Zian, and Jenna obviously love each other and their sibling relationship is important to them. This fabulous foursome loves the outdoors and having fun in the sun! They also love going on vacations and new adventures together. They like going to the park, riding bikes, and just spending time together. All of the children are very smart and enjoy school. They each have goals in life and hope to accomplish them. Arial, Justin, Zian, and Jenna are looking forward to vacations with their forever family.</p><p><b>Visit us at the <a href="http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Adoption_and_Foster_Care/Texas_Heart_Galleries/HighPlains/pages/Jenna_Zian_Arial_Justin_79580.html" target="_blank">Heart Gallery of the High Plains</a>.</b></p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=63209'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
