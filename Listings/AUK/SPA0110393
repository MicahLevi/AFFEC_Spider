        <div id='pNarr63762' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>     Kerrianne, Breanna, Kevin, Michael, Ella, and Hannah make up this ‘Super Six Sibling Group’. They are loving, smart, polite, intelligent, and caring kids. </p><p>     Kerrianne recently started high school and is eager to get involved in theater and singing. She describes herself as, “a talented singer and very unique."  </p><p>     Breanna is a sweet young lady with a strong personality. She said, “I like to dance and I like to draw." With the extra guidance and support that Breanna receives in school, both therapeutically and academically, she is learning to stay on track. She needs an adoptive family that will be supportive of the services that she receives. </p><p>     Kevin is polite, responsible, and very smart. He recently was given the opportunity to apply and interview with one of Philadelphia’s most prestigious grammar schools. When asked to tell a little about himself, he said, “I like to play football and (play) with my family. I play the trombone."  </p><p>     Ella and Michael are twins, but have strong senses of self. They both play instruments and excel in school. Ella proudly said, “I am the class president. I am also a dancer”, while Michael added, “I like to play sports. I am a brave person."  </p><p>     Hannah, the youngest of the family, is adorable and always smiley. She loves to give hugs and can always make you happy.  Hannah noted, “My favorite color is orange. My favorite food is Macaroni and Cheese."</p><p> </p><p>     All the kids do well in school. Some of them receive speech therapy for aid in pronunciation. The siblings are free for adoption and it is our goal to keep them together while they enter their forever family.</p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=63762'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
