        <div id='pNarr54368' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>     This adorable sibling group is comprised of five children: Jimmy, Taylor, Stephanie, Diane, and Brad. These children have a lot to offer a family: they’re all loving, kind, and currently residing in the same foster home. They’re hopeful to find a family willing to provide permanency to all five of them. </p><p>     Jimmy is the oldest child in the sibling group and is quiet. His focus is on family and he tends to be protective of his siblings and other extended family members. He enjoys sports, his favorite being football. He enjoys playing on a football team and is eager to continue doing so in the future. He also enjoys watching movies, getting on the Internet, and playing board games and video games in his free time. </p><p>     Taylor enjoys gymnastics, drawing, swimming, shopping, watching TV, and playing around on her cell phone and tablet computer. She hopes to become a veterinarian in the future. She wants people to know that she is “cute, fancy, strong, funny, talented, a Christian, a gymnast, and intelligent.” </p><p>     Stephanie is the middle child in this sibling group and she enjoys playing soccer, sports, watching TV, and swimming. She aspires to become a singer someday and wants people to know that she is “funny, awesome, talented, and a Christian.” </p><p>     Diane enjoys going to the park, swimming, playing with Lego blocks, shopping, and doing “girly” stuff like painting her nails and getting her hair fixed. Her favorite colors are pink, purple, and blue. She hopes to join karate in the near future, something she has been dreaming of for quite a while. </p><p>     Brad is the youngest sibling and has an easy-going personality. He’s a sweet boy who generally does what he’s told (even by his older siblings). He loves to play with dinosaurs and animals and hopes to become a bus driver when he grows up. He loves to watch TV, loves animals, enjoys playing with blocks and colors, and loves to play outside. </p><p>     Although this group is not currently free for adoption, once a family is identified, the county will move forward to make them so.</p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=54368'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
