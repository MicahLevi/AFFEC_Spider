        <div id='pNarr62586' class='stHide cSrchRlt'><p>Markell, Mya, Makiyla, Maliyah, and Michael have hearts full of hopes and dreams and cannot wait to share with their forever family.   This sibling group of five really enjoys playing outdoors and watching television in their spare time.  They also enjoy going to the park, watching movies, and playing board games.  At times, if one child begins to have an outburst, the other children will follow their lead.  However, all of them do well with re-direction and time outs. All five of the children attend supportive services and are benefiting from those services and support.  Markell, Mya, Makiyla, Maliyah, and Michael enjoy being in the same foster home so they are able to interact with each other on a regular basis.  They are able to function independently but it is recommended that they are supervised.  The children look forward to participating in field day at school, summer camps, and activities within the community. </p><p>Maliyah, Mya, Michael, Makiyla, and Markell will do best with an active family who is willing to keep them involved in fun and innovative activities.  They need a family who will provide appropriate supervision and re-direction when needed.  A family is desired who will be patient and will ensure that all of their educational and behavioral milestones are met.  Their family must be sensitive to the children's needs.  The ideal family will ensure that the children continue to attend supportive services.  The children will further benefit from individual attention and also spending group quality time with the family.  Parents who can explain that it is okay to have differences will be beneficial.  A family who can foster positive and healthy relationships between the siblings is desired.  Markell, Mya, Michael, Makiyla and Maliyah all wish to continue to be active in church.  All of the children wish to be a part of a family who will allow them the opportunity to express their individuality and to be a part of a forever home that can commit to them for the rest of their lives. </p><div class='bodyContent nextStep'><h2>Ready to take the next step?</h2><ul class='srchRslt'><li>Learn about <a href='/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care'>adopting from foster care</a>.</li><li><a href='/photolisting/family-registration-form'>Register your family</a> (home study required).</li><li><a href='/_app/login/login.aspx?cc=62586'>Log in</a> to make an inquiry.</li></ul></div></div>
