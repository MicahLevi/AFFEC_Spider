	> SpiderDriver.php:	Initializes and runs other classes. Takes the website abrv. as an argument
						  and runs the scraper and mapper for that website. It also tracks which
						  sites have been run, runs an aggregator on their findings, runs the
						  database updater, and sends all information for that run to the Reporter
						This class is meant to be run multiple times throughout the day from a
						  cronjob. Each website will get its own job, which can scrape the site
						  and generate a new Listing object to check versus the Database. However,
						  some sites contain information for the same children, in which case the
						  database updates cannot be made until all of those sites have finished,
						  and the last one to finish then runs ListingAggregator.php
	
	SCRAPING
		> SpiderScraper.php: Calls the other Scraping Agents to get the child profiles in html format.
							   Handles the file comparisons for determining if a child listing has
							   been updated. Saves each profile into Listings/$STATE_ABV/$STATE_ID,
							   and returns the filenames of children whose pages have changed since
							   last run.
		> SearchAgents.php:  Calls the Paging Agent to get pages, and searches them for the following:
								> Link to the next page of Listings
								> Links to Child Profiles
								> Child profile html (Throws away unneeded information on child page)
							 The SearchAgent class is ABSTRACT, which means it cannot be directly
							   instantiated, and you must instead use/create a child class. There are
							   currently 2 methods/agent-types for searching through the html:
								> DOM - uses simple_html_dom
								> REGEX - uses preg_match_all
		> PagingAgents.php:  Base class, PageAgent provides the pageRequest function, which takes a url
							   and uses cURL to return the html for that page.
							 ASPX_PageAgent is an extension, which visits an ASPX search form page and
							   obtains the cookie and gathers postfields (Usually __VIEWSTATE etc.) from
							   the page, so that the site can be navigated without the use of a javascript
							   engine.
		> URLGenerators.php: Used to generate the next page url for certain sites. Allows for different
							   methods of counting up pages. It can provide both a link, as well as the
							   necesarry postfields for navigating to the next page of listings.
	MAPPING
		> SpiderMapper.php:			An ABSTRACT Base Class, which gets passed an array of filenames to
									  create Listing objects for. It checks if the file exists, then
									  passes it to the mapListing function, which returns the Listing
									  object for that child/sibling-group. It also takes an array of given
									  attributes for a listing on that site (i.e. $state=Ohio for OAPL)
		> class.SpiderListing.php:	Class object for child structuring child information so that it can
									  easily be input into our databases
		> PreprocessProfile.php:	
		> ListingAggregator.php:
